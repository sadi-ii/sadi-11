I myself am a survivor of sexual violence, which was an experience that continues to shape my life in subtle and unsubtle ways, decades after the horrible event. It is with that experience, that I attempt to speak about a different, though no less troubling, phenomenon: the destructive power of misapplied language, particularly when it comes to public accusations of sexual misconduct. When Lucius (a pseudonym), a famed writer known for his activism in feminism and humanism, was accused of grooming and sexual harassment, the pristine reputation he built with hard work crumbled to ashes. Everyone who adored him as a compassionate and empathetic intellectual figure now turned on him, seeing him as an irredeemable sexual predator. Now he is a persona non grata, a heinous monstrosity no one was willing to be associated with. That accusation struck like thunder one sunny day when he was baking sourdough for his students. They all looked at him with horrified and disgusted expressions, as if witnessing the presence of a serial killer right in front of them. A social media post was a common denominator on their phones, detailing a harrowing account of grooming and sexual harassment put Lucius under the unwanted limelight. His students, finding out that the teacher they respected was a sexual abuser, quickly vacated the premise, leaving him baffled by what happened. Then the uproar spread like a wildfire. An avalanche of misfortune befell him afterward, leaving him jobless and struggling financially for years. In short, he bore the worst brunt of a phenomenon called cancel culture. If he was exactly what he was accused of, then he deserved all the fire and brimstone. But he was not. Was Lucius a groomer? An investigation that was conducted a bit too late proved that he was not. Facts trickled through the cracks after pressures started to mount on both parties. Apparently, the “victim” was an adult, almost a decade past the age of consent. What had passed between them, she finally admitted, had been consensual. Was Lucius a harasser? More accounts showed that it was a bitter relationship, strained by poor communication and unmet expectations rather than harassment or violence. But not the monster people had conjured in their minds when they heard the story on social media. None of the truth mattered because Lucius was already fired from his workplace, and many people, unwilling to revise their perception about Lucius after new findings, still label him as a sexual predator. The crowd that had burned him in effigy had moved on. They do not look back. They do not say, “Perhaps we were wrong and need to apologize for burning him at the stake. And here we arrive at the crux of this essay: the power of a word. Throughout history, thinkers and storytellers alike have warned us of the dangers inherent in language. Some of you may have heard this from ancient mythologies and biblical narratives. Some learned about this from the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, in which readers were cautioned to remain vigilant against the bewitchment of language. It has the capacity to obscure, mislead, and seduce the intellect under the guise of clarity. And this is exactly the problem here. Take a look at the following words. Groomer. Depression. Abuser. Gaslighter. Mansplainer. Narcissist. Bipolar. These words mean something really important in understanding the human mind and its relations with others. But now, when these complex symbols of meaning are taken to the arena of social media where not everyone has the same level of comprehension, they are tossed carelessly like rocks, its meaning blunted by misled repetition, misused until they turn into gravel that lost its original meaning. Take “gaslight,” for example. Everyone nowadays seems to be gaslighted by their friends and family, if every single social media post is to be believed. Now, it is thrown like a tantrum of an illiterate juvenile: “You disagreed with me, therefore you gaslit me.” The word is emptied of its meaning and wielded without care. Sadly, that’s not the case. Most people’s definition of “gaslight” is a perversion of what it really meant as a psychological term. Being gaslit requires an intent from the perpetrator to manipulate the victim by questioning their memory methodically and to ruin their sanity. It’s far more malicious than what people on social media meant when they used this word. The problem I am trying to highlight here stems from a hyperfixation of words or terminologies that many people can find on social media. These are academic terms that require context and nuances more than are provided in any dictionary for them to understand. Hastily and naively, these trigger-happy people use complex concepts as blunt instruments of accusation and moral judgment. Sometimes they end up misdiagnosing and overly pathologizing their own situation, damning themselves in a whirlwind of confusion with the words they barely understand. The use of psychiatric or legal terminology in public discourse may feel empowering to those naming their pain or damning people they don’t like. Maybe, for some people, it feels good and affirmative to label themselves depressed when they are just sad. To call someone who annoys you a narcissist may also feel validating to your pain. Initially, this seemed to be harmless. But it also contributes to what we might call semantic inflation: the process by which a word’s meaning becomes diluted, generalized, or misapplied due to overuse and imprecision. Imagine, then, what happens when words so heavy with denotative and connotative meaning — words most people don’t fully understand without literacy in certain disciplines — are used carelessly by nearly everyone. Imagine when someone tells everyone that you are racist for pointing out religious corruption. In this haze, language ceases to be a bridge between minds and becomes a wall built from assumed meanings. The wall does not lead you to understanding. It leads to more misunderstandings, living on the pillars of an illusion of understanding. The danger is not just in the mislabeling itself, but in the reaction it provokes. The outrage isn’t proportionate to the facts — it’s proportionate to the word. People respond not to what happened, but to what they believe the word means, even when their understanding of it is shallow at best. This is a disaster, to say the least. Living in the age of such arbitrary use of language can be dangerous. One can accuse the other of something heinous without understanding what the word means, and most people would believe that and destroy the lives of possibly innocent people in a mob mentality rage. Now, at this point, some of you may have an idea to accuse me with labels. Mansplainer. Pedantic. Prescriptivist. Before you start accusing me with words that you may not fully understand, ask yourself, how many lives of innocent people should be destroyed until we realize that we should be careful with words? I need to remind you that this is not a clamor to doubt or invalidate survivors, nor to pick rationalism over complex human experience. Rather, this essay is a reminder for us to take language seriously. If we believe that words have power in shaping our society for the better, then we must also believe that misusing them can lead to more injustice. By misusing language, we risk manufacturing wrongs and becoming the architects of injustice through the illusion of goodwill. We need to see that when accusations rely on language that is semantically ambiguous or emotionally overloaded, the pursuit of justice can lose its purpose. Under the haze of misunderstandings and confusion, language transforms into a blind performance of punishment. A witch hunt. And we become no better than those in the past who committed this grave injustice. What should we do to become better than our predecessors, then? Today, under the thumb of social media, we are all at risk of losing our sense of real understanding. We are like a blind flock of sheep being dictated by a digital mob unwilling to read things comprehensively. And sometimes, this mob leads us to misdirected rage. To resist that enchantment, we must first return to clarity by doing the simplest of things. Asking what a word means before using it so confidently seems simple. So many people neglect this most fundamental aspect of language, though. Yet it was often necessary. In doing so, we sharpen our pursuit of a better society. We may diagnose the right wrongs, not the other way around. In such a situation, we must rely on universally accepted semantics to avoid confusion that may lead to persecution of the innocents. In the end, there is great and necessary power in the collective refusal to tolerate cruelty, exploitation, or abuse. But like any power, the cancel culture requires discipline. For patience. For the humility to learn before leaping. Not jumping to conclusions based on hazy remarks about someone’s behavior. Like fire, the real strength of cancel culture lies not in its swiftness in its spread of rage like a wildfire, but in its potency to illuminate — to uncover, to correct, to protect. But it only does so if we are willing to think first rather than letting ourselves be slaves to misleading tweets. Only then can we hope to burn away the rot without also scorching the living. P.S: Now, it may be tempting for some of you to lambast me for resorting to linguistic prescriptivism as a solution to this problem because of the hypothetical notion that it is a huge part of cultural oppression, but let me propose a Scylla-Charybdis situation for you to think of. Ask yourself this, how would you deal with the fact that language arbitrariness itself also leads to some form of injustice? -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to

https://medium.com/@mawovan/against-sectarianism-slander-and-cancel-culture-in-the-palestine-solidarity-movement-8b2cf4b21e46,20-February-2025,"Against Sectarianism, Slander and Cancel Culture in the Palestine Solidarity Movement!","Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in -- Listen Share Dear activists, supporters and organizers in Vancouver’s Palestine Solidarity Movement, When the Zionist Israeli genocide against Palestinians in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, many of us, some long-time activists and organizers and some new to the movement, felt that the most important thing to do is to come to the streets in solidarity and defence of Palestine. With our many different interpretations of the best demand to use, the best action program to practice, here in Vancouver and around the world we were united on the fact that divisions had to be overcome to work together against the brutality inflicted on the steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza. I met many people reading this message, at protests and actions for Palestine, to write press releases and design posters, and to join with the many community groups new to organizing to lend a hand, a megaphone, a flag — whatever was needed. When I say “I,” I refer to myself and the organization I represent. I am the chair of Mobilization Against War and Occupation (MAWO), and I am proud and honoured to work with fellow organizers. A year ago in February 2024, some of the same people we had been working side-by-side with for Palestine released a calculated slander campaign against MAWO aimed at dividing the Palestine solidarity movement in Vancouver. As documented in the following letter to Charlotte Kates of Samidoun, which I am making public, there are many reasons why some groups and people participated in this slander campaign — political differences, organizational differences, sectarianism — but as has become clear in recent months, there are people acting within the Palestine solidarity movement who aim to divide it, and whose actions and motivations are highly suspicious. Using intimidation and harassment tactics With no whatsoever evidence, in a defamatory public statement, MAWO has been falsely and unjustly accused of attempting “to seize control from Palestinians and local neighbourhood groups by using intimidation, division, manipulation, and silencing tactics.” Interestingly, these accusations are actually the actions of those slandering MAWO. Some ringleaders in this slander campaign gave ultimatums to groups to sign the sectarian and false statement against MAWO, threatening them with being excommunicated from the Palestine solidarity movement. People were ordered not to talk to MAWO organizers or participate in their events for fear of ostracization. These suspicious actors have spread the faces and names of MAWO organizers and supporters, doxing activists in a way that reeks of the behaviour of our imperialist enemies. Those who have tried to stand up against this slander campaign and witch hunt against MAWO, who have tried to talk reason to this “cancel culture” frenzy, have also been threatened, removed from organizing chat groups and ostracized. So, who is really guilty of “intimidation, division, manipulation and silencing tactics?” Defamation campaign against MAWO and its organizers The accusations against MAWO are so wildly outrageous, so removed from the truth, and so easy to dispel by asking critical questions or using one’s own experience. If you read the slander statement against MAWO published on Medium — at https://medium.com/@exposingmawo/keeping-our-communities-safe-exposing-the-harms-of-mawo-6244ab07bb04 — you can also read that the only comments on the post are three responses defending MAWO and pointing out the undemocratic, suspicious and sectarian nature of the campaign against MAWO. While these comments have not been deleted, any comments defending MAWO and questioning the slander campaign on the Free Palestine BC’s Instagram post against MAWO were deleted. Criticism, due process or the right to defence was not welcome in this witch hunt campaign against MAWO. To be clear, the accusations against MAWO are false, baseless, untrue and sheer lies which read like a fiction novel. Scare tactics have been used against MAWO, using fear-inducing words like “sexually predatory behaviour” and “physical assault” without evidence and even without incidents cited. These are very serious allegations, and one must ask, if they are true, why haven’t charges ever been laid against MAWO members? In fact, the only crime being committed is against MAWO members, which is the crime of spoken and libel defamation. MAWO expands its Palestine solidarity work When the slander campaign against MAWO was released in February 2024, after careful consideration, MAWO decided not to release a public response. Just as provocateurs seek a reaction and escalation, we felt the perpetrators of the slander campaign sought to distract the Palestine solidarity movement from organizing for Palestine and to turn the attention of the movement to the destructive witch hunt against MAWO. Immediately after the release of the slander campaign, MAWO supporters who attended the Vancouver Palestine rallies organized by the former coalition faced harassment, so MAWO organizers decided not to attend rallies where they were sure to be confronted, drawing attention from what the rally SHOULD be focused on — united struggle for Palestine. While MAWO had plenty of cause to speak out against those carrying out the slander campaign against MAWO, and to name names, when it came down to the question of what is best for the Palestine solidarity movement, our answer was we did not want to retaliate against those organizing for Palestine. We felt a response at the time would contribute to further demoralization of those getting involved in Palestine solidarity activism. We have seen the effect of this slander campaign on new activists who have joined expecting unity and solidarity, only to find division, sectarianism and in-fighting. While we had all rights to take those slandering to legal and judicial institutions, we decided not to pursue that avenue but first to challenge it politically. We’ve always thought the defamation campaign against MAWO must be dealt with politically and conducted to foster a culture of respectful dialogue and critical analysis. Instead, MAWO focused on doing what we have consistently done in the last 21 years of our existence — we continued to educate, organize and mobilize for Palestine. MAWO held weekly info booths in downtown Vancouver, talked to thousands of people, handed out information about Palestine, and collected hundreds of signatures on MAWO’s Palestine postcard campaign to Biden. MAWO held weekly picket actions for Palestine in front of the US Consulate, bringing attention to the role of US imperialism in arming, funding and working hand-in-hand with Zionist Israel to commit genocide in Gaza. MAWO held weekly banner drops for Palestine throughout Metro Vancouver. MAWO has held forums and discussions in Vancouver and continues our national and international Palestine solidarity efforts. Last April, we attended and helped organize the United National Antiwar Coalition (UNAC) conference in Minneapolis, United States, where we were invited to speak on a panel about Palestine. We were also invited to attend and present about Palestine at the International Seminar for Peace and the Abolition of Foreign Military Bases in Guantanamo, Cuba, last May. MAWO endorsed, tabled at and attended the People’s Conference for Palestine in Detroit last May, organized in part by the Palestinian Youth Movement. All the while, on MAWO’s website and email announcements, we continued to promote the Vancouver Palestine rallies from which we had been excluded. Sectarianism and slander campaigns kill our movement At this time, 12 months after the slander campaign against MAWO split the Palestine solidarity movement in Vancouver, we see the result. Right now, Zionist Israel, working with the US, Canada and other imperialists, is advancing their ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza. Attacks, detention, torture, forced displacement and the killing of Palestinians in the West Bank are increasing. Genocidal Israel, with the support of all imperialists, are destroying Jenin and northern West Bank. The Israel-US war drive has expanded to Lebanon, Yemen and Syria and is maneuvering for the next round of war and destruction. At a time when it is more important than ever to have a unified political force, consistent and focused on organizing for Palestine, the movement in Metro Vancouver has become further fractured and split. Turnout has dropped significantly, from upwards of 5000–6000 people before the slander campaign against MAWO to around 75–150. Vancouver lost the momentum for building a robust movement for Palestine. Sectarianism and further splits and divisions reduced the number of activists resulted in isolated groups and actions that are effectively toothless. This is due to the lack of political clarity, consistency, lack of leadership, and also due to some disruptive and sectarian, factionalist or ultra-leftist tactics, such as burning the Canadian flag, or using ultra-leftist slogans and rhetoric, which had no connection to the current state of Palestinian’s struggle or the resistance movement in Gaza or West Bank. Basically, instead of focusing on building a mass solidarity movement for Palestine in Metro Vancouver, these self-centered misleaders were busy with self-aggrandizement. Hence, these wrong tactics and sectarianism resulted in a critical decline of participation that we are facing today. These so-called organizers that are not around anymore practiced and implemented the leftist elitist tactics of hit and run rather than strategizing to build an effective militant mass movement. Hence, this grave mistake resulted in losing people’s trust and pushing them away from attending Palestine solidarity actions, and opened the space and path for police and other government agencies to intervene. Attacking MAWO with slander and smear campaigns are the tools and methodology of the police and government, not of the working class and oppressed people. At this time, I believe it is necessary to speak out. This is not just to defend MAWO, the most consistent organization doing solidarity work for Palestine for more than two decades, but also to share our perspective on rebuilding and growing the Palestine solidarity movement at this critical moment in Metro Vancouver. Manufacturing crisis, diagnosis and the solution MAWO is publicly sharing the following letter, which was sent to Charlotte Kates and Samidoun Vancouver on February 8, 2024, one year ago. In this letter, we are asking for an explanation on the unprincipled, undemocratic exclusion of MAWO — to date, I have not received a response. This letter also shares the fundamental issues and problems within the Palestine solidarity movement in Metro Vancouver and the so-called “coalition” that MAWO was part of from October 7, 2023 to February 2024. I hope that we can learn from the organizational and political mistakes and do what is necessary — rebuild a strong and united Palestine solidarity movement in Metro Vancouver. I also want to clarify that while we share this letter and our criticisms of Samidoun and others in the Palestine solidarity movement, we also defend and support Samidoun’s right to organize and exercise their free speech. MAWO unequivocally condemns the political targeting, unfair charges and raids by the Vancouver Police Department against Charlotte Kates and Samidoun. No matter our disagreements with the politics of an organization, the police and other repressive institutions cannot make excuses for the state to lay phony charges and harassment against pro-Palestine activist organizations. MAWO calls strongly on the government of Canada to remove Samidoun from their terrorist entities list, to drop all phony and illegitimate charges by Vancouver Police Department (VPD) and to abolish the terrorist entities list altogether. The terrorist entities list is used by the government of Canada to arbitrarily and undemocratically silence dissent, bypass the legal system, and deny the right to due process and a fair trial. MAWO believes that an important task of the Palestine Solidarity Movement today, without delay is to defend Samidoun’s right to free speech and assembly, and to defend all activists and organizations facing government and police repression. An organized and unified defence is vital and is already long overdue. Any protest and opposition movement that cannot defend freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and civil rights is doomed to fail. To defend artistic and intellectual freedom is vital for any protest movement to advance. The ruling class and Zionist methods must be rejected and condemned in the solidarity movement I encourage people in the Vancouver Palestine Solidarity Movement to read this and the following letter with a critical mind. While we expose Zionist misinformation and lies and ask people to educate themselves on the abundant information supporting Palestine, should we not also be critical of accusations and misinformation within our movement and seek out evidence? While we call for fair trials and due process and defend democratic rights, while under attack from imperialist governments and police, shouldn’t we practice due process, follow democratic norms and allow for a fair defence against accusations and libel within our movement? When we build a consistent, strong and united Palestine solidarity movement, free of division, we are strengthening our ability to fight back against Zionist and imperialist attacks on Palestine, on West Asia, and against Palestine solidarity activists and organizers here at home and abroad. I am confident we can join together in rebuilding the Palestine solidarity movement in Metro Vancouver to build a united front calling for a continued ceasefire in Gaza without Zionist violations and plans for ethnic cleansing, an end to the genocide, an end to the siege on Gaza, Israel out of West Bank, and for the self-determination of Palestine. I want to finish my introduction to this letter with a great quotation from an activist who responded to the defamation statement on Medium, which indicates the level of sincerity and political maturity we need in this critical time of organizing and fighting back, “Most notably in the final paragraph, this united group pays lip service to the value of solidarity while also finding the time and energy to bicker and divide over personal differences, in the middle of the occupation’s continuing campaign of visceral slaughter, torture, kidnap, and displacement.” In solidarity, Janine Solanki Chair — Mobilization Against War & Occupation (MAWO) — — — Forwarded Message — — - From: Janine Solanki <janine_solanki@yahoo.ca> To: Charlotte Kates; Samidoun Vancouver (emails omitted) Sent: Thursday, February 8, 2024 at 01:55:56 a.m. PST Subject: Request for explanation on splitting the Vancouver Palestine solidarity movement Hi Charlotte, I am sure you are very aware of the sectarian split that is right now occurring in the Palestine solidarity movement in Vancouver. I am writing you, as the representative of Mobilization Against War and Occupation (MAWO), which you have been working with closely over the last 4 months, to ask for an explanation. On Tuesday night I joined the coalition zoom meeting, which only Rawan, Rafif, Dave and I joined. It was very obvious that during this meeting a decision was being made behind closed doors to exclude me and MAWO, since in the space of 15 minutes the meeting went from casual conversation, to Rafif and Rawan not speaking and not responding to a question I asked them (although this lack of response is unfortunately usual), to them leaving the meeting abruptly without saying a word. Then within an hour I saw that Rafif had removed me from the coalition signal chat. A few minutes later Rawan also removed Alison from the security signal chat. Then I saw that Samidoun has removed from Instagram the poster I designed last week and has posted a new poster without any demands, including removing Ceasefire Now and with MAWO’s logo removed, for the February 10 Palestine rally. For four months I have been working in the coalition on behalf of MAWO and you know full well our record of working in the spirit of unity and collaboration. I have given my opinion and suggestions, as any group should in a healthy coalition, but also always deferred to the decision of the coalition. I have been the most consistent person joining meetings and taking on tasks, without stepping on the very delicate toes of some coalition members. Yet suddenly I have been removed from the coalition signal chat, totally undemocratically with absolutely no discussion or explanation, with no charge of what supposed wrong was done to justify this expulsion, and with no opportunity to defend myself. I think after four months of working together in the coalition we deserve an explanation. To me this whole act resonates like conducting a coup d’etat. Is the coalition as a whole unofficially expelling MAWO from the coalition? On what basis was this exclusion decided? Was this decision supported by Samidoun, and if not, does Samidoun denounce this exclusion? From the Samidoun Instagram post of a rally poster that removes MAWO’s logo, it seems that this decision is supported by Samidoun. While I have been removed from the coalition signal chat, neighbourhood groups and other organizing chats in Vancouver in the last day, there has not been a single explanation provided for this sectarian and factional exclusion. The only explanation I can see is that certain ill-intentioned individuals have intervened in the Palestine solidarity movement in Vancouver to distract activists and organizers from the actual important work of protesting the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza and demanding self-determination for Palestine, and have instead spent entire days spreading slander, gossip, rumours, and fear mongering about a group that has been consistently supporting Palestine solidarity organizing in every corner of Metro Vancouver. This is absolutely not in the interest of the Palestinian people in Gaza, and has now split the Palestine solidarity movement in Vancouver and changed an atmosphere of collaboration, unity and motivation to one of distrust, gossip, division and distraction. I’m wondering who is organizing these show trials behind closed doors, and how come MAWO as the accused has not been invited to hear the accuser, in order to have a fair trial. Also, when you invited MAWO to the Vancouver Palestine Action coalition four months ago, you were fully aware of the slander campaigns and witch hunt that has been conducted against MAWO for years. What is this new “MAWO is a cult” theatrics about? This targeted, widespread and secretive exclusion of MAWO from Palestine solidarity organizing in Vancouver is not something that will go quietly and can be swept under the rug. This is a dangerous precedent, and it signals the involvement of suspicious forces that split movements through sectarianism, slander, character assassination, gossip, rumours and division, which is more in the interest of the police and capitalist state — those that would like to see the Palestine solidarity movement slowed down, fractured and weakened as this exclusion is doing. On our part in MAWO, we are writing a detailed response and will go public with this, because exclusion and sectarianism does not belong in the Palestine solidarity movement. You know well that my position and the position of MAWO has been to work for more mass mobilizations, and to build the movement with more unity and large numbers of people on the street. To my face you have said you agree with this, but then your actions have shown otherwise. In coalition meetings I have constantly referred to the strategies of other cities that have built large and consistent demonstrations in the 10’s or 100’s of thousands or even over a million people, while in Vancouver we have gone from 5000 in November to now one or two thousand people, even though Vancouver has the capacity for demonstrations in the 10’s of thousands. This has been due to the loss of momentum, consistency and any real outreach plan, a lack of leadership and lack of confidence in building a mass movement with all kinds of excuses made in coalition meetings, or counterposing disruption tactics to mass actions, as if they are separate from each other. Surprisingly our position for consistent mass action is a point of contention from some of the coalition groups who do not see the importance of building a consistent mass movement, although this is something that protesters have been constantly asking MAWO for more of, and which you yourself have said Samidoun gets messages asking for. We have consistently explained in coalition meetings that building mass action and a mass movement is important side by side with disruptions and shut it down actions. However, without building a strong mass solidarity movement, disruptions will be ineffective and a mockery of an effective disruption. The bigger the mass movement, the bigger and more effective are disruption tactics. Is the reason we have not been given an explanation for MAWO’s unprincipled expulsion because the coalition groups don’t want to put “we want to slow down organizing for Palestine, and MAWO keeps asking to continue consistent mobilization” on the record? Isn’t it true that that those who have rushed to exclude us in the last day are the same people that MAWO was very concerned about with their attempts and tactics to purposely slow down mobilizing and who refused to organize weekly marches and rallies in Vancouver? Isn’t it true that in every meeting or on the coalition chat I had to ask many times to schedule the dates of upcoming rallies in advance, instead of scheduling them haphazardly with a few days notice? Most of the time in coalition meetings or the coalition signal chat I heard either no response or partial and vague responses to my questions or suggestions, to a degree I have never before witnessed in any coalition, network or organization I have worked in. Isn’t it true that now, on Thursday at the time of this email to you, we don’t know our next march and rally after February 10? And if you do know, why has it not been announced for the purpose of giving people time to adjust their schedules in advance in order to attend, and to allow neighbourhood groups the opportunity to schedule their actions. Is it difficult to decide on holding a rally and march more than a few days or a week in advance, for example considering February 17 and 24 coming up? Our record in MAWO is clear. We have been organizing Palestine solidarity actions and events for 20 years, as well as supporting the work of other Palestine solidarity groups, Samidoun included. We have the clarity of vision that the most important task is protesting against the genocide in Gaza, calling for an immediate ceasefire (which you have unilaterally disagreed with), and demanding self-determination for Palestine.

https://medium.com/@adhvik19m/cancel-culture-0ca154e3aafa,11-May-2025,Cancel Culture: The New VIGILANTE,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in -- Listen Share Introduction: What is Cancel Culture? We live in an era where a stand-up can start a mob, ruin reputations, and raise the degree of punishment far more than the severity of the offense — or even worse, when there’s no crime as per the law at all — all this is ignited by cancel culture. For some years now, as the world has been burning in the flames of ideological hatred, which often doesn’t shy away from getting political, a new term has been floating around — cancel culture. It is just a newer, and even more brutal, way of boycotting someone. Cancel culture refers to the practice of excluding somebody from social or professional life by refusing to communicate with them online or in real life because they have said or done something that other people do not agree with (Oxford English Dictionary). Historical Context of Cancel Culture This term does not only affect a particular individual or a company, but society as a whole, as it starts a new wave of fueling hatred. The origin of this culture of canceling is not something new; it has been around and persisted for centuries. In 399 BCE, Socrates was sentenced to death for “corrupting the youth” just because he questioned traditional beliefs and promoted rational thinking, which offended the authority of the elites and the Gods (Plato). Then, in 1517, the 95 Theses written by Martin Luther greatly changed the dynamics of society and were opposed by the forces of traditional authority of the Church. He was spiritually cast out of the Church, sent into exile, and the king declared him an outlaw — meaning anyone could kill him legally (McGrath). His difference of thought from the mainstream resulted in the Protestant Reformation. He might have offended some sects of people in that era, but looking back, he is a hero of free thought and conscience. Both Socrates and Martin Luther were canceled by the dominant power structures of their respective eras — a parallel to online mobs now. These were just two of the many such early examples of “cancel culture” before it even had a name. What this essentially implies is that cancel culture is not a modern invention, but rather a manifestation of human behavior through the ages. It should not be blamed on the new generation or the rise of the internet and social media. It’s more about human nature and how people react when someone goes against the mainstream. It’s about one’s maturity in responding to new trends in society. I would agree that this system of canceling is undoubtedly distinct from what was prevalent centuries back. In that era, the authority to initiate a boycott was in the hands of the aristocrats and the elites, and limited power in this matter was exercised by the people, but now with the rise of social media and newfound freedoms, this dynamic has changed (Muirhead & Rosenblum). The Dangers of Mob Mentality and Misjudged Accountability As this responsibility is now in the hands of the people, it is important to examine every such instance with fairness and maturity. The concept of canceling someone is often justified as the only way for holding people accountable for their actions where the justice system often fails to be just, which might be true in some particular cases. Rather than fostering accountability, this culture ends up marginalizing communities, falsely accusing individuals, and making the punishment far more severe than the offense through vigilantism (Nguyen). As the reach of social media expands, and people’s impaired judgment and ability to be irrationally offended reigns, increased intolerance, suppression of free speech, and encouragement of mob mentality will continue to deteriorate the fabric and integrity of a tolerant, democratic society (Binns). Has the rise of people-powered justice tipped into digital vigilantism? To truly understand the impact of cancel culture, it is essential to evaluate both its positive potential and its harmful consequences. Accountability Through Social Empowerment As we highlight the merits — cancel culture, at its best, can be seen as a tool of societal empowerment, and it makes society truly democratic as the power shifts from elitist and often unjust institutions to the hands of the people (Rosenblum). Cancel culture is a voice in shaping the norms, and it’s a system to hold the offender accountable. Sometimes, canceling someone becomes the need of the hour, and this often highlights the situation in the eyes of the law. One of the most famous cases is of Sean Combs ‘Diddy,’ a once-celebrated music icon and businessman. Over the years, he has built an empire in the entertainment industry, influencing hip-hop culture. Behind all the glitz and glamour of the industry, he hides his criminal face — a disturbing reality. He has been accused of several heinous crimes, and is now trapped by the justice system — sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, obstruction of justice, bribery, drug abuse, arson, assaults, sexual misconduct with minors, filming illicit video without consent, and whatnot. All these came to the spotlight just because of cancel culture, which empowered the victims of the monster Diddy is. Now, as an aftereffect of being canceled, the call for his businesses and his craft being boycotted was made (Klein). Cancel culture in this case did not act as blind mob justice. It acted as a lifeline. Social media became a platform where victims were finally believed, supported, and amplified. The scrutiny brought on by public outrage pressured authorities to act, raised awareness, and forced the world to pay attention to allegations that otherwise might have remained buried by wealth and power. Without this societal tool, the severity and scale of the alleged crimes might never have come to light. The Harmful Effects of Cancel Culture At the same time, it becomes important to put the demerits of cancel culture in the spotlight to make a balanced comparison before we jump to a conclusion. The Duke Lacrosse team of 2006 faced huge false allegations for which they were canceled. Three of the members — David Evans, Collin Finnerty, and Reade Seligmann — all got their reputations ruined just because of the effects of cancel culture. They had hired an exotic dancer for a team party — Crystal Mangum, who had filed a false rape case against the three. These allegations quickly got national attention. This soon attracted debates on race, privilege, and sexual assault and worsened the situation. Though there was a lack of evidence, due to wide cancellation, they faced public condemnation — they were painted as symbols of toxic masculinity and white privilege. Even the institution faced a backlash. Duke University canceled the lacrosse season, and even the coach resigned under the immense pressure. This case of cancel culture made the students endure harm to their personal and professional life, despite their innocence. Under the pressure of the culture, the legal system was overpowered by the impaired judgment of the irresponsible public. The three men legally attained innocence after one whole year, and true justice and public redemption took much longer, as only in 2018, Mangum finally admitted to have fabricated the story (Bennett). I would like to highlight another instance which has had much less impact than the above-mentioned case but it shows how cancel culture is practiced regularly by targeting and getting offended by the most trivial of details. The Bollywood film Pathaan, released in January of 2023, faced an uproar in December ’22 because of an insignificant detail in its song “Besharam Rang.” A popular Bollywood actress, Deepika Padukone, who was playing a lead role in the movie, was seen wearing a ‘saffron’ colored bikini as the lyrics played “shameless color” (translated). This enraged the conservatives who easily took offence. The whole country witnessed the start of a mass mob, just because they thought the filmmakers deliberately had presented the saffron color to be shameless — that too on a bikini. The posters of the film were torn down, posters of Shah Rukh Khan were burned, riots had started and the producers were warned against the release of the film (Sharma). Conclusion and the New Definition I don’t know if anything else has had a greater psychological impact than cancel culture after the Nazi concentration camps. We as responsible citizens of the world need to draw a clear distinction between accountability and cancel culture. To hold someone accountable for their actions and make them realize their mistake can only be achieved by constructive criticism and legal justice, not by mob justice and boycotts. While the intention may be to demand accountability, the method often becomes one of collective punishment and intense public shaming. Being “canceled” can lead to anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts in individuals who face a sudden and overwhelming backlash — sometimes for a minor mistake or a misunderstood comment. The internet doesn’t forgive or forget easily, and even long after the initial controversy fades, the digital footprint remains, often destroying careers, relationships, and mental stability (Muirhead & Rosenblum). For the public, cancel culture creates a climate of fear and conformity. People become hesitant to express honest opinions or engage in difficult conversations, worrying that one wrong word could bring their downfall. This silencing effect is especially dangerous in academic spaces, comedy, journalism, and public discourse, where freedom of speech and critical thinking are essential. Instead of fostering growth or change, cancel culture often replaces education with humiliation, turning social media into a courtroom where empathy is in short supply and nuance is nowhere to be found (Binns). It is fair to say that we have reached a point where a redefined understanding of cancel culture is both necessary and justified… Cancel Culture is a practice to marginalize or boycott an individual, community, or brand with a punishment which is supported by digital vigilantism, irrational and immature decision making, ability to get offended quickly, and mobs that are often disproportionate to the severity of the crime. At the same time, this culture sometimes remains successful in holding people accountable to the crimes they have committed and brings them in a spotlight in the eyes of the law. -- -- Help Status

Cancel culture is a revolving door on social media. At some point, every brand, celebrity, and influencer has been canceled. Ellen DeGeneres has been canceled. Goya has been canceled. Kanye has been canceled more than once. The prebiotic soda brand Poppi was recently canceled. Cancel culture is an internet phenomenon that refers to the withdrawal of support from someone at the fault of them doing something wrong or controversial. Meredith Clark, a professor at the University of Virginia, told The New York Times that “it’s ultimately an expression of agency… think of it like a breakup and a taking back of one’s power.” Social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X are the birthplace of cancel culture. As soon as someone makes an objectively controversial move, all it takes is for one person to call them out until everyone follows suits. Poppi, the prebiotic soda brand, recently faced backlash online for gifting influencers stocked vending machines of their product to celebrate the Super Bowl. Many people took to social media to air out their grievances that this was a bad move on their part, giving them marketing (or moral) advice that they should have sent their product to communities that couldn’t afford it. TikTok users thought that it was too gauche to send the vending machines to already, seemingly, rich influencers. “Why couldn’t Poppi just send the vending machines to colleges, hospitals, police stations, or fire stations? Make it make sense,” wrote one TikTok user. Some influencers took it upon themselves to share the wealth and donate the gifted product in their community, while others kept it for themselves. Most people support the backlash and have chimed in on calling Poppi out. Others call it “genius marketing.” Whether you stand on the side that Poppi made the right move or not, not much productivity came from their five-minute scandal. Allison Ellsworth, the founder, took to TikTok to address the controversy, claiming misinformation fueled the backlash. The internet quickly moved on to the next thing. When it comes to cancel culture, social media users often see shades of gray when it comes to the debate. According to a study done by Pew Research Center, “58% of Americans say… calling out others on social media is more likely to hold people accountable, while 38% say it is more likely to punish people who don’t deserve it.” Cancel culture has proven it’s not some casual, 2- week trend. As it gains more of a presence, so does the debate surrounding it. It begs the question, “Are people rushing to judge or trying to be helpful?” In an article written by the New York Times, cancel culture can be a form of social ostracism or exclusion from a group in society at its core. Even without meaning to be, the publicized hate and judgment from cancel culture foster a space for cyberbullying and toxicity. When we think of cancel culture, our mind automatically thinks of celebrities or anyone who has a following, but canceling can also happen off the screen. Social exclusion can impact younger kids, especially those who are still forming their identities. Hopping on the bandwagon just because others are doing it doesn’t justify the “trend” of canceling someone. Cancel culture doesn’t just impact the “cancelers” or the “canceled,” but those on the outside too. Constantly having a negative outlook on any situation instills fear and doesn’t make room for meaningful conversation. Counselors at Carlow University said that the best solution to cancel culture is to unplug from social media, refrain from participating, and consider having a conversation when you aren’t behind a screen. Breaking up with celebrities or brands because our values don’t align is a good kind of cancel culture. In a world where transactional dynamics consume our everyday lives, it wouldn’t be wrong to pick and choose who you support. One student from Norfolk, VA, said we should address problematic actions by helping people recognize their mistakes rather than aggressively calling them out in public. The Poppi scandal showed us that consumers align with brands that are authentic and transparent, as opposed to ones that are only focused on influencer marketing. The era of cancel culture has shown us how quickly a brand can go from being popular to being questioned. It was a lesson learned for both the consumer and the brand. Instead of outright rejecting cancel culture, we need to build a culture that holds space for accountability and transformation. Maybe we can’t fully escape the inevitability of cancel culture, but we can choose how to engage with it. It surrounds us whether or not we are in front of the camera or behind the screen. -- -- The Voice of Gen-Z Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech",sign sign sign sign voic gen listen share trend social medium cancel cultur inevit cancel cultur revolv door social medium brand celebr influenc cancel ellen degener cancel goya cancel kany cancel prebiot soda brand poppi recent cancel cancel cultur internet phenomenon refer withdraw support fault wrong controversi meredith clark professor univers virginia tell york time ultim tongu stick ression agenc breakup take power social medium platform tiktok instagram birthplac cancel cultur make object controversi move take person call suit poppi prebiot soda brand recent face backlash onlin gift influenc stock vend machin product celebr super bowl peopl social medium air grievanc bad move give market moral advic product commun couldn afford tiktok user gauch send vend machin seemingli rich influenc couldn poppi send vend machin colleg hospit polic station fire station sens write tiktok user influenc share wealth donat gift product commun peopl support backlash chime call poppi call geniu market stand poppi move product minut scandal allison ellsworth founder tiktok address controversi claim misinform fuel backlash internet quickli move cancel cultur social medium user shade grai debat studi pew research center american call social medium hold peopl account punish peopl don deserv cancel cultur prove casual week trend gain presenc debat surround beg question peopl rush judg help articl write york time cancel cultur form social ostrac exclus societi core mean public hate judgment cancel cultur foster space cyberbulli toxic cancel cultur mind automat celebr cancel happen screen social exclus impact kid form ident hop bandwagon doesn justifi trend cancel cancel cultur doesn impact cancel cancel constantli neg outlook situat instil fear doesn meaning convers counselor carlow univers solut cancel cultur unplug social medium refrain particip convers aren screen break celebr brand valu don align cancel cultur world transact dynam consum everydai life wouldn wrong pick choos support student norfolk address problemat action help peopl recogn mistak aggress call public poppi scandal consum align brand authent transpar oppos focu influenc market era cancel cultur show quickli brand popular question lesson learn consum brand outright reject cancel cultur build cultur hold space account transform escap inevit cancel cultur choos engag surround front camera screen voic gen statu career press blog privaci rule term text speech,4,6,0.21480206540447502,0.17624784853700515,0.07504302925989673,0.038898450946643716,0.06540447504302926,0.34492254733218586,0.0846815834767642,4,Cultural Sanctions & Cancel Justice

It’s when individuals or groups are publicly shamed and ostracised for something they’ve said or done, often online. Some defend it as a way for marginalised people to hold powerful individuals accountable when traditional systems fail. Others argue it’s a dangerous form of censorship that shuts down free speech and creates an environment where no one feels safe to speak their mind. So, which is it? Is cancel culture an essential tool for accountability, or is it just a digital mob mentality that focuses more on punishment than progress? Accountability or Just a Trend? Let’s first break down the core idea of cancel culture: accountability vs. punishment. On one hand, cancel culture undeniably gave power to those who previously had none. It has allowed ordinary people to call out powerful figures for their harmful actions or words. When celebrities, politicians, or public figures make problematic statements or perpetuate injustices, cancel culture gives the public a way to say, “This is not acceptable anymore.” It’s about reclaiming power in a space where speaking up can often feel futile or even dangerous. Think about the #MeToo movement, for example. Women and men who had suffered in silence for years began finding their voices, and cancel culture provided a way to ensure the powerful were held accountable. When we saw figures like Harvey Weinstein exposed for their abuses, it wasn’t just about seeing someone pay for their actions — it was about creating a safer space for survivors to speak out and making it clear that abuse would no longer go unchecked. But here’s the flip side: It loses its original purpose when we push cancel culture too far. Holding someone accountable is important, but completely cancelling them without room for redemption or growth can quickly become much darker. It becomes about punishing someone, not changing their behaviour. And while it might feel good to see someone “get what they deserve,” the consequences can be far-reaching, affecting not just the person at the storm’s centre but entire communities. The Consequences: Who Gets Hurt? Cancel culture isn’t as black-and-white as it’s often portrayed. While public figures like celebrities or politicians might seem able to handle the heat, the true consequences frequently affect the most vulnerable the hardest. Take marginalised groups, for example. These are the individuals whose voices are already often silenced or overlooked. For them, cancel culture can be a double-edged sword. On one side, it can offer solidarity and a sense of community. On the other hand, it can amplify the struggles they already face. If they say something misinterpreted, taken out of context, or deemed offensive, they often find themselves in a position where the backlash is swift and brutal. These individuals can’t afford to make mistakes, and the consequences can be life-altering, even if the offence wasn’t intentional. Artists and activists face a similar challenge. Many rely on their platforms to speak out against injustice and push boundaries. However, cancel culture holds them to an impossible standard, often scrutinising past actions or opinions under a microscope. A single misstep can result in them being completely erased. The problem is that we stop seeing people as complex human beings who can change and learn — we treat them like disposable commodities. This leads to real-world consequences, too. The emotional toll on those targeted by cancel culture is substantial. Anxiety, depression, and social isolation are common reactions to public shaming. People may lose their livelihoods, support systems, and even their self-worth. So, we must ask: Is cancel culture really about justice, or is it just another form of digital mobbing? The Future: Where Do We Go From Here? Where does cancel culture go from here? Will it continue to evolve into a stronger, more punitive form of social justice, or will we find a way to balance accountability with compassion? The truth is, we don’t know yet. We’re still trying to figure it out as a society. The goal shouldn’t just be to punish people. It should be about learning, growing, and transforming together. If we truly want to make a difference, we must stop looking at cancel culture as a weapon of destruction and start thinking of it as a tool for dialogue. Can we hold people accountable without erasing the possibility for them to learn and grow? Can we push for change without silencing the conversation? This is the challenge we face moving forward. Are we so focused on tearing others down that we forget the importance of rebuilding and growing together? Ultimately, our goal should never be to destroy but to create a society where people, especially those in power, are held accountable, allowed to make mistakes, and given the space to evolve. The Bottom Line Cancel culture is complicated. It can hold people accountable and silence the voices it aims to protect. The future of cancel culture isn’t about deciding right or wrong — it’s about finding a balance between justice and compassion. And that’s something we all need to work toward together.

It’s a term that has been on everyone’s lips lately, and it isn’t going away anytime soon. In fact, it seems to be becoming more pervasive in our society. But what exactly is cancel culture? Why is it the lowest form of humanity? And how can we move away from it? At its core, cancel culture is the idea of publicly shaming someone for their beliefs or actions — usually by making threats of boycotts or other forms of retribution against them if they don’t comply with a certain opinion or ideology. This often leads to people being subjected to unfair criticism and ostracization from wider society. It can also lead to people feeling disempowered and unable to express themselves freely, as the fear of being ‘cancelled’ looms over any interaction. In essence, cancel culture is an attempt to control speech and thought through fear, bullying and intimidation. This makes it particularly damaging as it denies individuals their right to voice their opinions without fear of repercussion. It stifles creativity and expression while exacerbating existing power dynamics between those who have a platform and those who don’t have one yet. The effects of cancel culture are wide-reaching; not only does it limit freedom of speech, but it also affects mental health in diverse ways — from feelings of anxiety and depression due to public backlash and ostracization, to reduced self-esteem due to regularly being judged by others on social media platforms such as Twitter or Instagram. Moreover, cancelling people instead of engaging with them in meaningful dialogue prevents us from engaging with different perspectives which could potentially offer valuable insights into our own views — a crucial part of growing both as individuals as well as societies at large. Similarly, cancelling an individual does nothing to address underlying social issues such as institutionalized racism, sexism or homophobia; these must be tackled at the root rather than merely punishing offenders superficially. Finally, when we engage in cancel culture we are sending a message that punishment trumps progress; that silencing someone is better than engaging with them constructively; that ad hominem attacks are acceptable instead of having reasoned debates on controversial topics; that personal responsibility goes out the window when there’s an opportunity for moral grandstanding on social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook; and finally that shaming someone else should take precedence over trying to understand why they might have acted in a particular way in the first place. -- -- I’m Branden Collinsworth, blending neuroscience, movement, and ancestral wisdom to unlock potential and create lasting transformation.

https://medium.com/@californiayouthstemproject/cancel-culture-the-psychology-behind-the-storm-2c3b1f974245,12-July-2024,Cancel Culture: The Psychology Behind the Storm,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in -- Listen Share Written By Jasmin Chan;CYSP Student Writer “Cancel culture is about rushing to judgment. I’d love us to all slow down, go, ‘Stop, let’s think about this. Does this person deserve never to have a career?’” - Richard Bacon, English television and radio presenter Cancel culture, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is “the mass withdrawal of support from public figures or celebrities who have done things that aren’t socially accepted today.” Various social media users on a plethora of platforms attempt to take action in “calling out” social media users and influencers in their past or current actions that would be considered controversial by societal standards. The list goes on pedophilia, racism, an insensitive joke — people go to great lengths to ensure someone’s platform fails after being “canceled.” Cancel culture provides interesting moral dilemmas: How much power does a bystander have over this situation? The people involved in the “canceling” most of the time are usually not the victims of said creators, but instead just non-involved Internet users who dedicate hours to collecting evidence against influencers and other various social media users. While scrolling on Twitter, you can find thread after thread of anonymous users posting about others: “This is why you should unfollow ______ ” or “A timeline of _____ controversy.” What inclines users to become so attached to influencers and streamers that they go out of their way to police their every move on the Internet and in real life? To simplify the vast phenomenon of cancel culture, there are two factors to consider– audience and purpose: “Audience” can be associated with the parasocial relationships users make with one another online. Parasocial relationships according to findapsychologist.org is “are one-sided relationships, where one person extends emotional energy, interest and time, and the other party, the persona, is completely unaware of the other’s existence.” People begin to form parasocial relationships on the Internet due to a desire for social recognition from online interactions: Likes, comments, reposts — all pseudo-materialistic enrichment that triggers dopamine in one’s brain and therefore creating a deeper feeling of “want” while scrolling through social media. This instance is specifically called the Uses and Gratification Theory, coined in the early 1940s by Katz and Blumler, the theory suggests that people don’t use media passively just to pass time, but rather they seek out psychological satisfaction through interaction with posts or videos. As people gain a false sense of connection with others online, seeing their posts or tidbits of daily lives through social media, they begin gaining a false sense of friendship and infatuation with others online– psychologically satisfying their need for human connection, despite the connection being completely one-sided. The other factor that can be associated with the “purpose” of cancel culture, fueling people to go to great lengths to cancel others, is Internet vigilantism, the psychology of cancel culture. Internet vigilantism can be defined as a social obligation users feel on the Internet to participate in calling out other fellow social media users. Stemming from vigilantism, a civilian who attempts to take the law into their own hands, Internet vigilantism is when various users attempt to enact higher moral ground on others and perform their own “justice” online. In Social Media Victimization Theories and Impacts of Cyber Punishment by Jessica Enami, she connects the sociological theories of QST and TMT to internet vigilantism, “human beings turn to social media groups not only to spread their own beliefs and ideas before they die but also to seek acknowledgment and affirmation” (Enami 7). Even before social media, humans have been looking for social validation through athletics, academics, etc, and since the introduction of these applications, the carnal urge for acknowledgment has been intensified. Internet vigilantism and cancel culture allow users to find backhanded ways to find affirmation and support online, simultaneously garnering a new, larger audience from callouts, and bringing down content creators and other users. From being considered offensive to certain people or odd controversies regarding pieces of media, cancel culture has taken the Internet by storm and become an easily accessible strategy to isolate users on the Internet socially. During quarantine, when everyone had been attached to their phones, there were a handful of various cases of content creator controversies, being “canceled” over the smallest of issues, or the worst of crimes. The phenomenon of cancel culture is not just about holding people accountable; it often involves a public outcry on social media platforms where users collectively decide to shun or boycott a person, brand, or entity — leading to significant real-world consequences. -- -- Articles, Blogs, Success Stories, etc; Empowering and Educating the Next Generation of Youth through the World of STEM 🌱🌐! @cayouthstemproject on Instagram Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech",sign sign sign sign listen share write jasmin chan cysp student writer cancel cultur rush judgment love slow stop person deserv career richard bacon english televis radio present cancel cultur merriam webster dictionari mass withdraw support public figur celebr aren social accept social medium user plethora platform attempt action call social medium user influenc past current action consid controversi societ standard list pedophilia racism insensit joke peopl length ensur platform fail cancel cancel cultur moral dilemma power bystand situat peopl involv cancel time victim creator involv internet user dedic hour collect evid influenc social medium user scroll twitter thread thread anonym user post unfollow timelin controversi inclin user attach influenc streamer polic move internet real life simplifi vast phenomenon cancel cultur factor audienc purpos audienc parasoci relationship user onlin parasoci relationship findapsychologist org side relationship person extend emot energi time parti persona complet unawar exist peopl begin form parasoci relationship internet due desir social recognit onlin interact like comment repost pseudo materialist enrich trigger dopamin brain creat deep feel scroll social medium instanc specif call gratif theori coin katz blumler theori suggest peopl don medium passiv pass time seek psycholog satisfact interact post video peopl gain fals sens connect onlin post tidbit daili life social medium begin gain fals sens friendship infatu onlin psycholog satisfi human connect connect complet side factor purpos cancel cultur fuel peopl length cancel internet vigilant psychologi cancel cultur internet vigilant defin social oblig user feel internet particip call fellow social medium user stem vigilant civilian attempt law hand internet vigilant user attempt enact moral grind perform justic onlin social medium victim theori impact cyber punish jessica enami connect sociolog theori qst tmt internet vigilant human social medium spread belief idea die seek acknowledg affirm enami social medium human social valid athlet academ introduct applic carnal urg acknowledg intensifi internet vigilant cancel cultur user backhand affirm support onlin simultan garner larg audienc callout bring content creator user consid offens peopl odd controversi piec medium cancel cultur internet storm easili access strategi isol user internet social quarantin attach phone hand content creator controversi cancel issu bad crime phenomenon cancel cultur hold peopl account involv public outcri social medium platform user collect decid shun boycott person brand entiti lead signific real world consequ articl blog success stori empow educ gener youth world stem seedl globe meridian cayouthstemproject instagram statu career press blog privaci rule term text speech,7,1,0.34552974864778874,0.053770283168946865,0.12503977091950366,0.04040725421571747,0.20299077314667513,0.12949411390391347,0.10276805599745467,7,Public Ethics & Cancel Culture Ideology
https://medium.com/@zitalucacsatho/the-dark-side-of-cancel-culture-a-modern-witch-hunt-1a01e908b7ad,30-August-2024,The Dark Side of Cancel Culture: A Modern Witch Hunt,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in -- Listen Share In recent years, the phenomenon of cancel culture has risen to the forefront of societal discourse. What began as a tool for holding individuals accountable for harmful actions has morphed into a dangerous and pervasive form of public shaming, often disproportionate to the alleged offense. This modern-day version of ostracism has seen female celebrities, athletes, public figures like Blake Lively, Imane Khalif, Gal Gadot, and Amber Heard just to mention some of the most brutal crucifixions of the past few years, become prime targets. These women are frequently scrutinised not just for their actions or words, but also for their appearances, personal choices, and even their silence on certain issues. The fervour with which the public seeks to âcancelâ them bears a striking resemblance to historical witch hunts, medieval public executions, and systematic feminicides. The Modern Witch Hunt: Parallels to History Throughout history, society has found ways to ostracise, persecute, and eliminate those it deems unacceptable or threatening. The witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, predominantly targeting women, were a systematic attempt to root out perceived evil, fuelled by fear, ignorance, and a desire to control. Similarly, public executions until modern days served as a barbaric form of spectacle, where the masses could project their frustrations and anger onto an individual. Both instances reflect societyâs propensity to channel its collective dissatisfaction and fears onto a scapegoat. Today, the digital landscape has given rise to a similar form of societal purge â cancel culture. While the tools may have changed from stakes and guillotines to tweets and hashtags, the underlying psychology remains alarmingly similar. Female celebrities, in particular, face relentless scrutiny and are disproportionately targeted. In the past, accusations of witchcraft were often based on flimsy evidence, superstition, or societal bias against women. Today, women are âcanceledâ based on out-of-context comments, paparazzi photos, or even rumours. The mob mentality of the internet can be as irrational and unforgiving as a medieval crowd baying for blood. Why Women Are Prime Targets The targeting of women in cancel culture reveals deep-seated misogyny that persists in society. Female celebrities are often judged not just by their actions but by their very existence. Blake Lively, for instance, has faced backlash for everything from her fashion choices to her comments about her husband and her recent filmâs It Ends With Us promotion. Imane Khalif, the Algerian female boxer who earned not only a gold medal but also international recognition at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, became a target of both admiration and animosity. Her remarkable performance challenged the societal norms, and the backlash she faced highlights the enduring discomfort with successful and strong women â making her a powerful symbol of what patriarchy fears. Gal Gadot, the Israeli actress best known for her role as Wonder Woman, has frequently been the subject of severe online hatred, largely due to her past service in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and her identity as an Israeli and Jewish woman. Despite her success in Hollywood, Gadotâs background has made her a target of criticism and hostility, often entangling her in geopolitical conflicts and anti-Semitic rhetoric. This animosity underscores the broader issue of how personal and national identities can render individuals vulnerable to extreme public backlash, regardless of their professional achievements. Amber Heardâs highly publicised legal battles have made her a lightning rod for criticism, regardless of the complexities involved. Without expressing judgment on whether their actions were right or wrong â as it is not my role to publicly adjudicate these matters â I wish to highlight the disproportionate and intense vitriol directed at women by the public. My intention is merely to draw attention to this troubling phenomenon. These women, like many others, find themselves held to impossible standards. They are expected to be flawless, morally unassailable, and perpetually in line with the ever-changing demands of social justice. When they inevitably fall short, the backlash is swift and severe. The fervour with which the public seeks to âcancelâ these women reflects societyâs discomfort with powerful, outspoken, or simply visible women. It is a modern form of control, attempting to silence and disempower women who step outside the narrow confines of what is deemed acceptable. The Need for Scapegoats: A Reflection of Societal Malaise The driving force behind cancel culture is often a combination of moral superiority and schadenfreude. In an age of economic uncertainty, social upheaval, and personal dissatisfaction, people seek an outlet for their frustrations. Canceling a celebrity offers a brief sense of power and justice, a way to assert control in an increasingly complex and uncontrollable world. The target becomes a symbol of all that is wrong, a convenient scapegoat for the anger and disillusionment that pervades modern life. However, this need to destroy someoneâs life, to see them fall from grace, reveals more about the persecutors than the persecuted. It is a symptom of a society that is struggling with its own sense of identity and morality. By tearing down others, individuals attempt to elevate themselves, to assert their own righteousness in a world where they feel increasingly powerless. Accountability vs. Mob Justice There are undoubtedly cases where public condemnation is justified. The crimes of individuals like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein were so egregious that public outcry and legal consequences were not only justified but necessary. In these cases, cancel culture functioned as a form of societal self-defense, exposing and holding accountable those who had perpetrated grave harm. However, the problem lies in the indiscriminate nature of cancel culture. Too often, the line between accountability and mob justice is blurred. Men frequently escape the same level of scrutiny and condemnation, even when their actions are far more damaging. This discrepancy reveals a double standard in societyâs application of justice, one that often protects powerful men while eagerly tearing down women. A Call for a More Civilised Approach The resurgence of witch-hunt-like behaviour in the form of cancel culture is a stark reminder that, despite our technological and societal advancements, human nature has changed little. We are no more civilised than the crowds that watched public executions or the villagers that accused women of witchcraft. The internet has merely given us a new arena in which to play out these ancient dramas. If we are to be truly civilised, we must strive to rise above the instincts that drive us to condemn and destroy. Accountability is crucial, but it must be tempered with empathy, understanding, and a recognition of our shared humanity. We must remember that behind every celebrity is a real person, with real feelings, complexities, and flaws. In the end, the moral of cancel culture is not that people should be immune from criticism or consequences. Rather, it is a call to be better than we were 600â700 years ago. To learn from the past, to reject the impulse to scapegoat and instead seek justice with wisdom and compassion. Only then can we hope to create a society that is truly just, fair, and humane. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech",sign sign sign sign listen share recent phenomenon cancel cultur rise forefront societ discours tool hold individu account harm action morph danger pervas form public shame disproportion alleg offens modern dai version ostrac femal celebr athlet public figur blake live iman khalif gal gadot amber hear mention brutal crucifixion past prime target woman frequent scrutinis action word appear person choic silenc issu fervour public seek cancel bear strike resembl histor witch hunt mediev public execut systemat feminicid modern witch hunt parallel histori histori societi find ostracis persecut elimin deem unaccept threaten witch hunt centuri predominantli target woman systemat attempt root perceiv evil fuel fear ignor desir control similarli public execut modern dai serv barbar form spectacl mass project frustrat anger individu instanc reflect societi propens channel collect dissatisfact fear scapegoat digit landscap rise similar form societ purg cancel cultur tool chang stake guillotin tweet hashtag underli psychologi remain alarmingli similar femal celebr relentless scrutini disproportion target past accus witchcraft base flimsi evid superstit societ bia woman woman cancel base context comment paparazzi photo rumour mob mental internet irrat unforgiv mediev crowd bai blood woman prime target target woman cancel cultur reveal deep seat misogyni persist societi femal celebr judg action exist blake live instanc face backlash fashion choic comment husband recent film promot iman khalif algerian femal boxer earn gold medal intern recognit olymp game pari target admir animos remark perform challeng societ norm backlash face highlight endur discomfort success strong woman power symbol patriarchi fear gal gadot isra actress role woman frequent subject sever onlin hatr due past servic isra defens forc idf ident isra jewish woman success hollywood gadot background target critic hostil entangl geopolit conflict anti semit rhetor animos underscor broad issu person nation ident render individu vulner extrem public backlash profession achiev amber hear highli publicis legal battl lightn rod critic complex involv tongu stick ress judgment action wrong role publicli adjud matter highlight disproportion intens vitriol direct woman public intent draw attent troubl phenomenon woman hold imposs standard tongu stick ect flawless moral unassail perpetu line chang demand social justic inevit fall short backlash swift sever fervour public seek cancel woman reflect societi discomfort power outspoken simpli visibl woman modern form control attempt silenc disempow woman step narrow confin deem accept scapegoat reflect societ malais drive forc cancel cultur combin moral superior schadenfreud ag econom uncertainti social upheav person dissatisfact peopl seek outlet frustrat cancel celebr offer sens power justic assert control increasingli complex uncontrol world target symbol wrong conveni scapegoat anger disillusion pervad modern life destroi life fall grace reveal persecutor persecut symptom societi struggl sens ident moral tear individu attempt elev assert righteous world feel increasingli powerless account mob justic undoubtedli public condemn justifi crime individu harvei weinstein jeffrei epstein egregi public outcri legal consequ justifi cancel cultur function form societ defens tongu stick os hold account perpetr grave harm lie indiscrimin natur cancel cultur line account mob justic blur frequent escap level scrutini condemn action damag discrep reveal doubl standard societi applic justic protect power eagerli tear woman call civilis approach resurg witch hunt behaviour form cancel cultur stark remind technolog societ advanc human natur chang civilis crowd watch public execut villag accus woman witchcraft internet arena plai ancient drama civilis strive rise instinct drive condemn destroi account crucial temper empathi understand recognit share human rememb celebr real person real feel complex flaw moral cancel cultur peopl immun critic consequ call ago learn past reject impuls scapegoat seek justic wisdom compass hope creat societi fair human statu career press blog privaci rule term text speech,8,1,0.3356362825941609,0.10006685981724983,0.2794740361043013,0.11410742143971472,0.036104301314909736,0.05638511254735904,0.07822598618230445,8,Public Ethics & Cancel Culture Ideology

Inquiries: https://digitalmehmet.com/ Subscribe to our content marketing strategy: https://drmehmetyildiz.substack.com/ -- 3 Listen Share What if I told you that cancel culture has the potential to make our society a better place? In this article Iâll argue why cancel culture actually serves an important role in our society and is something we need more of, not less. Cancel culture has become an increasingly prominent and controversial topic in recent years. The effects of cancel culture can be seen in the way it has widened conversations around social justice and sparked changes in policy. Cancel culture has the potential to shape society for the better. Itâs an effective way to spread awareness and encourage people to think critically about things that are going on around them. This can then inspire others to reflect on their own prejudices. Cancel culture can be used to reject harmful views, policies, and actions. This can help to prevent these type of views from spreading and normalising in society. Cancel culture is creating a new standard for society to prevent harmful actions from occurring in the future. There have been several examples of positive outcomes as a result of cancel culture. In some cases, public figures who have engaged in harmful or offensive behaviour have issued apologies and made efforts to change their behaviour as a result of cancel culture. For example, after being criticised for using racial slurs, actor Shia LaBeouf issued an apology and sought treatment for substance abuse and mental health issues. Companies have also made changes to their policies and practices as a result of cancel culture. After being criticised for its treatment of workers and the environment, fashion brand Burberry announced that it would stop burning unsold merchandise and would work to reduce its environmental impact. Cancel culture can also bring attention to social issues and encourage people to think critically about their own beliefs and actions. For example, the #MeToo movement, which was fueled in part by cancel culture, brought widespread attention to the issue of sexual harassment and assault and sparked important conversations about consent and respect. Cancel culture can also lead to changes in the way that certain topics are viewed and discussed. For example, cancel culture has contributed to the shift in how people talk about mental health, with more people becoming aware of the importance of seeking help and having open and honest conversations about mental health struggles. Cancel culture can be used to reject the actions of individuals who are holding others back from achieving social justice. This can help to push society forward and achieve greater equality. Cancel Culture gives the marginalised an amplified voice and is a way to challenge damaging narratives. Cancel culture has the ability to create accountability, especially for powerful people and institutions who otherwise seem untouchable. For a long time, our culture has not been holding people accountable for their abusive or insensitive actions; this is changing with cancel culture. People in positions of power had become accustomed to saying things without consequence, but cancel culture checks this privilege and it is beginning to change the way we look at these issues as a society. The concept of cancelling a person is really about questions of accountability. It communicates that certain behaviour wonât be accepted in a changing society. Cancel culture is not without its criticisms though. There are arguments that it can lead to the ostracisation of individuals and the suppression of free speech. While these are valid concerns, itâs important to remember that cancel culture is not about silencing or punishing people for expressing their beliefs. Itâs about holding people accountable for their actions and the impact they have on others. Cancel culture can be an effective and powerful tool to start meaningful conversations, when used correctly. Itâs about engaging people in meaningful dialogue and becoming forces for positive change in our society.

But the internet – particularly social media – has changed how, when and where these kinds of interactions occur. The number of people who can go online and call out others for their behavior or words is immense, and it’s never been easier to summon groups to join the public fray. The phrase “cancel culture” is said to have originated from a relatively obscure slang term – “cancel,” referring to breaking up with someone – used in a 1980s song. This term was then referenced in film and television and later evolved and gained traction on social media. Over the past several years, cancel culture has become a deeply contested idea in the nation’s political discourse. There are plenty of debates over what it is and what it means, including whether it’s a way to hold people accountable, or a tactic to punish others unjustly, or a mix of both. And some argue that cancel culture doesn’t even exist. To better understand how the U.S. public views the concept of cancel culture, Pew Research Center asked Americans in September 2020 to share – in their own words – what they think the term means and, more broadly, how they feel about the act of calling out others on social media. The survey finds a public deeply divided, including over the very meaning of the phrase. Pew Research Center has a long history of studying the tone and nature of online discourse as well as emerging internet phenomena. This report focuses on American adults’ perceptions of cancel culture and, more generally, calling out others on social media. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,093 U.S. adults from Sept. 8 to 13, 2020. Everyone who took part is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. This essay primarily focuses on responses to three different open-ended questions and includes a number of quotations to help illustrate themes and add nuance to the survey findings. Quotations may have been lightly edited for grammar, spelling and clarity. Here are the questions used for this essay, along with responses, and its methodology. As is often the case when a new term enters the collective lexicon, public awareness of the phrase “cancel culture” varies – sometimes widely – across demographic groups. Overall, 44% of Americans say they have heard at least a fair amount about the phrase, including 22% who have heard a great deal, according to the Center’s survey of 10,093 U.S. adults, conducted Sept. 8-13, 2020. Still, an even larger share (56%) say they’ve heard nothing or not too much about it, including 38% who have heard nothing at all. (The survey was fielded before a string of recent conversations and controversies about cancel culture.) Familiarity with the term varies with age. While 64% of adults under 30 say they have heard a great deal or fair amount about cancel culture, that share drops to 46% among those ages 30 to 49 and 34% among those 50 and older. There are gender and educational differences as well. Men are more likely than women to be familiar with the term, as are those who have a bachelor’s or advanced degree when compared with those who have lower levels of formal education.1 While discussions around cancel culture can be highly partisan, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are no more likely than Republicans and GOP-leaning independents to say they have heard at least a fair amount about the phrase (46% vs. 44%). (All references to Democrats and Republicans in this analysis include independents who lean to each party.) When accounting for ideology, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans are more likely to have heard at least a fair amount about cancel culture than their more moderate counterparts within each party. Liberal Democrats stand out as most likely to be familiar with the term. As part of the survey, respondents who had heard about “cancel culture” were given the chance to explain in their own words what they think the term means. The most common responses by far centered around accountability. Some 49% of those familiar with the term said it describes actions people take to hold others accountable:2 A small share who mentioned accountability in their definitions also discussed how these actions can be misplaced, ineffective or overtly cruel. Some 14% of adults who had heard at least a fair amount about cancel culture described it as a form of censorship, such as a restriction on free speech or as history being erased: A similar share (12%) characterized cancel culture as mean-spirited attacks used to cause others harm: Five other distinct descriptions of the term cancel culture also appeared in Americans’ responses: people canceling anyone they disagree with, consequences for those who have been challenged, an attack on traditional American values, a way to call out issues like racism or sexism, or a misrepresentation of people’s actions. About one-in-ten or fewer described the phrase in each of these ways. There were some notable partisan and ideological differences in what the term cancel culture represents. Some 36% of conservative Republicans who had heard the term described it as actions taken to hold people accountable, compared with roughly half or more of moderate or liberal Republicans (51%), conservative or moderate Democrats (54%) and liberal Democrats (59%). Conservative Republicans who had heard of the term were more likely than other partisan and ideological groups to see cancel culture as a form of censorship. Roughly a quarter of conservative Republicans familiar with the term (26%) described it as censorship, compared with 15% of moderate or liberal Republicans and roughly one-in-ten or fewer Democrats, regardless of ideology. Conservative Republicans aware of the phrase were also more likely than other partisan and ideological groups to define cancel culture as a way for people to cancel anyone they disagree with (15% say this) or as an attack on traditional American society (13% say this).

Given that cancel culture can mean different things to different people, the survey also asked about the more general act of calling out others on social media for posting content that might be considered offensive – and whether this kind of behavior is more likely to hold people accountable or punish those who don’t deserve it. Overall, 58% of U.S. adults say in general, calling out others on social media is more likely to hold people accountable, while 38% say it is more likely to punish people who don’t deserve it. But views differ sharply by party. Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that, in general, calling people out on social media for posting offensive content holds them accountable (75% vs. 39%). Conversely, 56% of Republicans – but just 22% of Democrats – believe this type of action generally punishes people who don’t deserve it. Within each party, there are some modest differences by education level in these views. Specifically, Republicans who have a high school diploma or less education (43%) are slightly more likely than Republicans with some college (36%) or at least a bachelor’s degree (37%) to say calling people out for potentially offensive posts is holding people accountable for their actions. The reverse is true among Democrats: Those with a bachelor’s degree or more education are somewhat more likely than those with a high school diploma or less education to say calling out others is a form of accountability (78% vs. 70%). Among Democrats, roughly three-quarters of those under 50 (73%) as well as those ages 50 and older (76%) say calling out others on social media is more likely to hold people accountable for their actions. At the same time, majorities of both younger and older Republicans say this action is more likely to punish people who didn’t deserve it (58% and 55%, respectively). People on both sides of the issue had an opportunity to explain why they see calling out others on social media for potentially offensive content as more likely to be either a form of accountability or punishment. We then coded these answers and grouped them into broad areas to frame the key topics of debates. Initial coding schemes for each question were derived from reading though the open-ended responses and identifying common themes. Using these themes, coders read each response and coded up to three themes for each response. (If a response mentioned more than three themes, the first three mentioned were coded.) After all the responses were coded, similarities and groupings among codes both within and across the two questions about accountability and punishment became apparent. As such, answers were grouped into broad areas that framed the biggest points of disagreement between these two groups. We identified five key areas of disagreement in respondents’ arguments for why they held their views of calling out others, broken down as follows: For the codes that make up each of these areas, see the Appendix. Some 17% of Americans who say that calling out others on social media holds people accountable say it can be a teaching moment that helps people learn from their mistakes and do better in the future. Among those who say calling out others unjustly punishes them, a similar share (18%) say it’s because people are not taking the context of a person’s post or the intentions behind it into account before confronting that person. In all, five types of arguments most commonly stand out in people’s answers. A quarter of all adults mention topics related to whether people who call out others are rushing to judge or are trying to be helpful; 14% center on whether calling out others on social media is a productive behavior or not; 10% focus on whether free speech or creating a comfortable environment online is more important; 8% address the perceived agendas of those who call out others; and 4% focus on whether speaking up is the best action to take if people find content offensive. The most common area of opposing arguments about calling out other people on social media arises from people’s differing perspectives on whether people who call out others are rushing to judge or instead trying to be helpful. One-in-five Americans who see this type of behavior as a form of accountability point to reasons that relate to how helpful calling out others can be. For example, some explained in an open-ended question that they associate this behavior with moving toward a better society or educating others on their mistakes so they can do better in the future. Conversely, roughly a third (35%) of those who see calling out other people on social media as a form of unjust punishment cite reasons that relate to people who call out others being rash or judgmental. Some of these Americans see this kind of behavior as overreacting or unnecessarily lashing out at others without considering the context or intentions of the original poster. Others emphasize that what is considered offensive can be subjective. The second most common source of disagreement centers on the question of whether calling out others can solve anything: 13% of those who see calling out others as a form of punishment touch on this issue in explaining their opinion, as do 16% who see it as a form of accountability. Some who see calling people out as unjust punishment say it solves nothing and can actually make things worse. Others in this group question whether social media is a viable place for any productive conversations or see these platforms and their culture as inherently problematic and sometimes toxic. Conversely, there are those who see calling out others as a way to hold people accountable for what they post or to ensure that people consider the consequences of their social media posts.  Pew Research Center has studied the tension between free speech and feeling safe online for years, including the increasingly partisan nature of these disputes. This debate also appears in the context of calling out content on social media. Some 12% of those who see calling people out as punishment explain – in their own words – that they are in favor of free speech on social media. By comparison, 10% of those who see it in terms of accountability believe that things said in these social spaces matter, or that people should be more considerate by thinking before posting content that may be offensive or make people uncomfortable. Another small share of people mention the perceived agenda of those who call out other people on social media in their rationales for why calling out others is accountability or punishment. Some people who see calling out others as a form of accountability say it’s a way to expose social ills such as misinformation, racism, ignorance or hate, or a way to make people face what they say online head-on by explaining themselves. In all, 8% of Americans who see calling out others as a way to hold people accountable for their actions voice these types of arguments. Those who see calling others out as a form of punishment, by contrast, say it reflects people canceling anyone they disagree with or forcing their views on others. Some respondents feel people are trying to marginalize White voices and history. Others in this group believe that people who call out others are being disingenuous and doing so in an attempt to make themselves look good. In total, these types of arguments were raised by 9% of people who see calling out others as punishment.   Arguments for why calling out others is accountability or punishment also involve a small but notable share who debate whether calling others out on social media is the best course of action for someone who finds a particular post offensive. Some 5% of people who see calling out others as punishment say those who find a post offensive should not engage with the post. Instead, they should take a different course of action, such as removing themselves from the situation by ignoring the post or blocking someone if they don’t like what that person has to say. However, 4% of those who see calling out others as a form of accountability believe it is imperative to speak up because saying nothing changes nothing. Beyond these five main areas of contention, some Americans see shades of gray when it comes to calling out other people on social media and say it can be difficult to classify this kind of behavior as a form of either accountability or punishment. They note that there can be great variability from case to case, and that the efficacy of this approach is by no means uniform: Sometimes those who are being called out may respond with heartfelt apologies but others may erupt in anger and frustration.  Acknowledgments – Appendix – Methodology – Topline  Below, we have gathered a selection of quotes from three open-ended survey questions that address two key topics. Americans who’ve heard of the term cancel culture were asked to define what it means to them. After answering a closed-ended question about whether calling out others on social media was more likely to hold people accountable for their actions or punish people who didn’t deserve it, they were asked to explain why they held this view – that is, they were either asked why they saw it as accountability or why they saw it as punishment.

https://www.ucf.edu/pegasus/is-cancel-culture-effective/,23-October-2020,Is Cancel Culture Effective?,"Fall 2020 | By Nicole Dudenhoefer ’17 | Illustrations by Matt Chase Mob mentality. A modern social justice practice. An impediment to free speech. A platform for marginalized voices. Call it what you will. Cancel culture is a concept so hotly debated that it remains in limbo, much like many individuals’ attitudes toward it. The one common theme everyone seems to agree on is that cancel culture involves taking a public stance against an individual or institution for actions considered objectionable or offensive. But is it an effective way to hold those in positions accountable, or is it punishment without a chance for redemption? In July, when Harper’s Magazine published “A Letter on Justice and Open Debate” — a critique on cancel culture without directly naming it — it was met with immediate backlash. The letter was initially signed by 153 notable individuals, including J.K. Rowling — who has recently faced calls for cancellation due to social media comments considered transphobic by some. For Mel Stanfill, UCF assistant professor of texts and technology, the letter is an example of how cancel culture can be a complicated practice. “I think cancel culture can reflect awareness that people are not willing to accept things that they used to accept or have not been able to resist in the past, but in some ways it’s a moral panic,” says Stanfill, who is also an assistant professor of English. “The Harper’s letter was a bunch of really rich and famous people writing in a national magazine about how they’ve been silenced — yet they still get access to this forum. So it highlights the fact that [cancel culture is] this fear over something that is not actually real. So if we’re going to talk about cancel culture, we can’t talk about it in isolation, we have to put it in context.” While public shaming and silencing are practices that have been around as long as society itself, cancel culture is a somewhat new concept with specific ties to Black culture. According to the news site Vox, the first reference of canceling a person in pop culture possibly comes from the 1991 movie New Jack City, when Wesley Snipes’ character, Nino Brown, says, “Cancel that [woman]. I’ll buy another one,” referencing his girlfriend’s disapproval of his violent ways. In 2010, rapper Lil Wayne referenced the quote in his song “I’m Single.” But it was after a 2014 Love & Hip-Hop: New York episode when cast member Cisco Rosado told his love interest “You’re canceled,” that the term gained traction on social media. Soon after, Black Twitter began using it both jokingly and seriously to express their disagreement with others. “There are also these series of practices on Twitter, some of which have come from Black Twitter, of skilled insults, which come from the Dozens, a game common in Black communities of finding clever ways to put someone down,” Stanfill says. And while cancel culture’s origins are linked to playful banter, it also stems from one form of protest: boycotting. Started by the Irish in the 1880s, boycotting became a powerful social and political tool used successfully by African Americans during the civil rights movement, such as the Montgomery bus boycott sparked by Rosa Parks. “If you don’t have the ability to stop something through political means, what you can do is refuse to participate,” said Anne Charity Hudley — North Hall Endowed Chair in the Linguistics of African America at the University of California, Santa Barbara — in the same Vox article. “Canceling is a way to acknowledge that you don’t have to have the power to change structural inequality. You don’t even have to have the power to change all of public sentiment. But as an individual, you can still have power beyond measure.” The internet heightens that power by collectively amplifying the voices of marginalized people who may be a minority — and otherwise silenced — in their physical communities. It’s also allowed others to become aware and support them as allies. Since #BlackLivesMatter began in 2014 after George Zimmerman was acquitted for killing Trayvon Martin, the hashtag has grown into a historic global movement. For decades, Black communities have spoken out about racial injustices and police brutality, but social media has bolstered attention around these issues and seriously shifted the nation’s recognition of the need for change — especially after the death of George Floyd. Social media’s public access has also allowed this form of public shaming to become a practice for people of all backgrounds to address varying issues. A core element of cancel culture, public shaming has been used since societies were first formed. Stocks, or public restraints, were used in medieval Europe up through Colonial America, where Puritans used them to punish criminals. Tarring and feathering was also a form of public corporal punishment used to keep people in line. And during World War II, French women who were deemed traitors had their heads shaved, says Stacey (Barreto) DiLiberto ’03 ’11PhD, a UCF lecturer in philosophy. Though often tied to personal punishment, public shaming has also been understood to be a positive social practice. “Public shaming is a long-standing public ritual that helped to uphold social bonds and make sure people within communities were equal and understood the norms, and to ensure no one got too high and mighty,” says Amanda Koontz, UCF associate professor of sociology. One common example, Koontz notes, comes from the !Kung people, a band society — the simplest known form of society — in southern Africa. During Christmas 1969, Canadian anthropologist Robert Borshay Lee presented the group with a large ox as a gift. Members made fun of his offering and called it a “bag of bones,” and it was later explained that this “shaming of the meat” practice was standard to keep someone humble whenever they brought back a large kill. “We have a tendency sometimes to say things via social media or other platforms that maybe we wouldn’t say if we were face to face with someone.”  This type of equalizing is understood to be a positive practice as the !Kung’s strong communal bonds have not been disrupted by the complex issues of modern societies, such as racism, sexism and political polarization. The in-person practice among people you know and live with also doesn’t translate to the scale of the global internet community, where often you’re ultimately engaging with strangers. Celebrities have always been highly susceptible to public criticism because of the nature of their privileged position. But in the era of cancel culture, they’re even more susceptible because they’re often viewed as agents of change, Koontz says. The #MeToo movement is one example of how publicly calling out powerful individuals can lead to a widespread cultural shift. When sexual abuse allegations against former film producer Harvey Weinstein became public in 2017, it led to his conviction as a sex offender. Other influential people have faced their own reckonings for similar misconducts, and societal attitudes toward sexism and sexual harassment are becoming more intolerant. But sometimes, public denouncement of powerful individuals can have the opposite effect of what is intended. When the Surviving R. Kelly docuseries premiered in January 2019, #MuteRKelly began trending, calling for the singer’s conviction for sexual crimes and an end to his career. But the increased negative attention around the artist seemed to backfire as on-demand streams for his music increased from 1.9 million the day before the docuseries began airing to 4.3 million — a 126 percent increase — on the day after the three-day premiere concluded. “The general public seems to have this power to hold accountable people who we’ve historically deemed powerful entities, but is that authority ultimately fleeting?” DiLiberto asks. “Yes, celebrities are real people too, and they say stupid things and do reprehensible things as well. But why should we care so much about what they do, as opposed to our own actions or our immediate community around us?” Whether you view cancel culture as empowering or destructive, the practice says a lot about our current cultural climate, which has been influenced by the increasingly digital world we inhabit. “We don’t have this distinction anymore between public and private, and it’s almost as if we’re living more of our lives online than we are in the real, tangible world,” DiLiberto says. This new way of living seems to be even more true during 2020, a time when we seem to be in constant crisis — from the COVID-19 pandemic to a resurgence in public awareness around long-standing racial injustices — all within an especially important election year. People are experiencing more unrest and heightened isolation, leading us to spend more time online. Globally, new social media users have grown by about 11 percent this year, and people are spending about 40 percent more time on social media, according to a July report from DataReportal. “If something comes on your timeline or feed, and it’s outrageous or terrible, we often have this knee-jerk reaction, rather than really investigating issues or listening,” DiLiberto says. “We share so much stuff online, and we have a tendency sometimes to say things via social media or other platforms that maybe we wouldn’t say if we were face to face with someone.” In instances where someone has done something particularly egregious, perhaps committing a serious crime such as sexual assault, the case to cancel may seem clear-cut. But in other instances where certain behaviors may be more questionable than seriously problematic, deeper thinking, which requires time and effort, about the person and issues is required but rarely happens. “The instant nature of social media means that very large, complicated social issues get condensed into one sentence, one minute for TikTok [videos] or just a photo on Instagram,” Koontz says. “Everything is becoming very succinct, and it both discourages nuanced discussion and encourages all-or-nothing stances. Cancel culture is ‘You’re all good, or you’re all bad,’ and human nature is much more complicated than that.” Humans are flawed beings, and it’s in our nature to make mistakes. And tactics such as online doxxing — publicizing private or identifying information — and their potentially permanent effects could leave everyone susceptible to being canceled. It’s worth asking, what motivates authentic, positive change? Amy Cooper — a white woman who called emergency services regarding Christian Cooper, a Black man, during a viral Central Park dispute about her illegally unleashed dog — has been fired from her job, charged with a misdemeanor for filing a false police report, and faced notoriety and ridicule. Cooper has apologized for her actions, but who determines the sincerity of it? She was dealt real consequences, yet racist incidents continue to happen and appear online daily. “When you have these forms of public shaming [oftentimes through] filming these interactions, it turns social issues into something that is completely individualized,” Koontz says. “It puts great responsibility on an individual, and it does not [always] encourage actual societal change. We haven’t taken care of the larger institutional or systemic issues.” Social media has certainly changed the way we communicate, providing more ways to connect than ever before. But in many ways, it’s dividing us and causing us to focus our energy where it isn’t always needed. “So often we are told, ‘We must act and speak out, or we are part of the problem,’ and therefore we are not necessarily taught or trained that inaction or not speaking out can be a form of social-justice action,” Koontz says. “At some point, we need to think about ways we can create positive change instead of fueling negative causes.” Perhaps we all need to take a step back and listen.

Ethics & Cancel Culture Ideology
https://www.depts.ttu.edu/rise/Blog/cancelculture.php,25-March-2024,Risk Intervention & Safety Education,"Check the trending page – who's cancelled today? While many of us have seen the term
                        cancel culture online, we don't know what it really means. Cancel culture is widely
                        known as a movement to “cancel” or remove celebrity status, and it's a dangerous bandwagon
                        to hop on (Vogels, 2022). Peer pressure's influence is ingrained into our culture.
                        We see one video or article and are totally convinced that it's true. However, the
                        truth is that cancel culture is not healthy and can lead to severe outcomes. I, myself,
                        am guilty of hopping on the train, but together we can learn how to be active bystanders
                        and cancel “cancel culture!” The phrase “cancel culture” first originated from the word cancel, meaning to cut
                        ties with someone. We've seen it referenced in film and television and we see it now
                        gaining traction on social media (Vogels, 2021). There are a variety of opinions on
                        what the purpose of cancel culture is for: holding people accountable, punishing those
                        who do wrong, or simply using it as a source of entertainment.  There is also often a confusion between “call-out culture” and “cancel culture”. Call-out
                        culture brings attention to someone's mistakes and gives them a chance to learn from
                        and correct the issue, while cancel culture immediately labels them as bad, sometimes
                        permanently (Toler, 2022). Call-out culture holds people accountable for their actions
                        by addressing problematic behavior while opening dialogue and discussion. This allows
                        people to understand each other better, ultimately creating an opportunity for reflection.
                        Compared to cancel culture, call-out culture's forgiveness fosters a sense of community
                        responsibility and encourages personal growth and learning. It recognizes that nobody's
                        perfect, we all make mistakes, and we can all learn from them.  According to the Pew Research Center, around 77% of college graduates say they have
                        heard about cancel culture as of 2020, and adults under 30 remain the most likely
                        age group to say that they have heard of cancel culture (Vogels, 2022). That's a lot
                        of people! Cancel culture has proven it's not just some casual, 3-month trend. That's
                        what makes it important to know the purpose of cancel culture. So many people hop
                        on the cancel culture bandwagon without knowing the harmful effects.  When we think about cancel culture, our brains autopilot to think about celebrities—people
                        with thousands of followers and a massive platform on social media However, we need
                        to recognize that cancel culture occurs on a variety of scales and is also applicable
                        to our friendships and daily lives. People can “cancel” their friends without thinking,
                        maybe even posting screenshots and accusations on social media for everyone to see
                        out of context. It's an unpleasant and exhausting process for all parties involved,
                        with or without the major celebrity status. In friendships, cancel culture may involve
                        calling someone out for doing something regarded as wrong and not allowing room for
                        apology or forgiveness (Brownstein, 2020). Here are some common ways that cancel culture
                        is easily spread on your own social media timeline: Cancel culture is applicable to all of us, regardless of whether we're constantly
                        in front of a camera. Being intentional with our relationships and being proactive
                        in being an active bystander when faced with unhealthy situations can help prevent
                        the negative impacts of cancel culture. You have the right to set your own boundaries and decide to whom you give your attention
                        and support, but in some cases, canceling a person has the opposite effect of what
                        was originally desired (Toler, 2022). Canceling often turns into bullying, particularly
                        cyberbullying, through uninformed gossip that misses the full picture with snap judgements.
                        Because canceling shuts down the opportunity to learn and grow from mistakes, this
                        makes the “canceled” more prone to becoming a target for hate, internet trolls, or
                        even death threats. Cancel culture doesn't just affect the “canceled” or “cancelers” but can also breach
                        onto the mental health of bystanders (Toler, 2022). With a negative outlook on a situation
                        involving cancel culture, onlookers can become overwhelmed with the idea that others
                        can use a mistake against them or misinterpret something they said. There is an active
                        fear of being canceled that stifles open, healthy discourse and discourages individuals
                        from speaking out or admitting their mistakes, ultimately hindering progress toward
                        meaningful change and growth. The primary way to intervene in cancel culture is to monitor your own behavior and
                        choose not to participate. For example, avoid making private issues public immediately.
                        When emotions are heightened, focus on communicating with the other person and being
                        open to other perspectives. This isn't to say conflict should never be posted about,
                        just that we should try to avoid it being our first knee-jerk reaction. You can also
                        intervene and become an active bystander if you see it happening on your social media
                        to others. If your friend, family member, or anyone you see is in a harmful situation
                        involving “cancel culture”, empower them to seek further education or to take time
                        to reflect offline. You may choose to help them by providing resources, being a mediator,
                        or trying to stop the situation from escalating. Whatever it may be, active, purposeful
                        intervention can save a messy situation from becoming explosive. Cancel culture may be an attempt to “make things right or “set people straight”, but
                        in the end, it isn't the only way—or even often the right way—to deal with someone's
                        mistake or interpersonal conflicts. Protect your peace and set healthy boundaries
                        when it comes to engaging in dialogue online to make sure that you're not just hopping
                        on a bandwagon. Make sure you know the facts of the situation and try to allow people
                        to learn and grow from their mistakes, we're all human after all. “Cancelling” cancel
                        culture does not mean absolving people from responsibility, it just means allowing
                        space for them to reflect on their behavior before banishing them from the internet

https://therapygroupdc.com/therapist-dc-blog/the-psychology-of-cancel-culture-impacts-on-mental-health/,29-October-2024,The Psychology of Cancel Culture: Impacts on Mental Health,"Therapy Group of DC We help you directly address your challenges with authenticity & warmth. Our therapists share their insights and expertise in the blog. LinkedIn Facebook Twitter In recent years, the term ‘cancel culture’ has risen to the forefront of societal discourse, particularly in Washington, DC. At its core, cancel culture represents a form of social ostracism where individuals or groups are thrust out of social or professional circles – either online, in the real world, or both. It’s a phenomenon that has been accelerated by social media, leading to rapid and widespread public judgments and reactions. As this practice becomes more prevalent, it’s imperative to understand its social implications and its profound impact on mental health. Check out our deep dive based on this post! It explores the key points in greater detail, with real-life examples and additional insights. Cancel culture has gained significant prominence in modern society, propelled by social, cultural, and technological factors. Socially and culturally, there’s growing awareness and sensitivity toward social justice, equality, and personal conduct issues. This heightened awareness, while fostering positive change, has also led to increased scrutiny of individuals’ actions and words, sometimes resulting in rapid negative public judgments. Technologically, the advent of social media has played a pivotal role. Platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram offer a global stage for discussion, activism, and, unfortunately, public shaming. These platforms amplify voices but also accelerate and intensify outrage and the cancel culture phenomenon, making it easier for large groups to coalesce around a cause or against an individual with unprecedented speed and scale. When the traditional justice system fails to address the concerns of marginalized groups, cancel culture can emerge as an alternative platform for seeking justice and making grievances known. From a psychological perspective, one of the critical concerns about cancel culture is its potential to stifle open dialogue and mutual understanding. The phenomenon of ‘cancel culture toxic’ can create an environment of toxicity and cyberbullying, where individuals are hesitant to express opinions or engage in discussions for fear of being ostracized or ‘canceled.’ This fear can lead to a homogenization of viewpoints, where only the most widely accepted opinions are voiced, while minority or controversial perspectives are silenced. Such a climate is antithetical to the core principles of mental health, which advocate for open dialogue, understanding, and the processing of diverse viewpoints. Social media platforms play a pivotal role in the perpetuation of cancel culture. These platforms provide a global stage for discussion, activism, and, unfortunately, public shaming. The widespread use of social media has accelerated the rise of cancel culture, allowing for rapid and widespread public judgments and reactions. Platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram can amplify voices, but they also accelerate and intensify outrage and the cancel culture phenomenon. The speed and scale at which information spreads on social media can lead to swift and often harsh judgments, impacting individuals’ mental health and societal dynamics. Free speech is a fundamental right essential for a healthy democracy. However, the rise of cancel culture has raised concerns about the limits of free speech. While cancel culture can be used to hold individuals and organizations accountable for offensive behavior, it can also be used to silence marginalized voices and stifle critical thinking. Striking a balance between free speech and accountability is crucial. It is essential to ensure that individuals can express their opinions without fear of retribution while also holding them accountable for their actions. This balance fosters a culture where diverse viewpoints can be shared and debated, promoting a more inclusive and thoughtful society. Cancel culture, with its often immediate and punitive approach to addressing perceived wrongs, can inadvertently stymie opportunities for enlightenment and education. When individuals are quickly ostracized for their mistakes or views, it leaves little room for learning or growth. A famous person, for instance, can face significant backlash and career repercussions when they are quickly ostracized for their mistakes or views. This lack of space for understanding and change can be detrimental to mental health, as it denies individuals the chance to learn from their errors, grow from their experiences, and develop a more inclusive and empathetic viewpoint. In lieu of the often punitive nature of cancel culture, there are alternative approaches that can foster accountability while promoting growth and understanding. These include: By emphasizing these alternative approaches, we can foster an environment where mistakes become opportunities for growth and learning, not catalysts for exclusion and division. Such a shift benefits both individual mental health and our society’s health, especially in Washington DC. We can create a more inclusive and empathetic culture that values growth and understanding over retribution through understanding, education, and compassionate accountability. Cancel culture can be a powerful tool for fostering accountability and social change. By calling out individuals and organizations for offensive behavior, cancel culture can bring attention to critical social issues and create a platform for dialogue. However, it is essential to ensure that cancel culture is used in a way that promotes accountability and social change, rather than simply punishing individuals for their mistakes. This can be achieved by promoting education, restorative practices, and compassionate accountability. By focusing on these constructive approaches, we can harness the potential of cancel culture to drive positive social change while minimizing its negative impacts. The experience of being ‘canceled’ can have significant mental health repercussions. Some individuals face extreme consequences, such as death threats, after being publicly called out for their views or actions. Individuals who find themselves at the center of a cancel culture storm often report feelings of anxiety, depression, and a sense of social isolation. This acute social rejection can exacerbate existing mental health conditions or even trigger new mental health problems. Conversely, those participating in cancel culture may experience a complex blend of emotions, from a sense of justice being served to potential remorse or guilt over the consequences of their actions. As a thought experiment, the Big 5 personality traits model – encompassing Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism – offers a lens through which to view the impact of cancel culture on mental health. Individuals high in Neuroticism, for instance, might be more prone to experiencing anxiety or stress as a result of cancel culture, whether they are the target or the participant. On the other hand, those with high Agreeableness may be more empathetic to both sides of the situation, potentially mitigating some negative mental health effects. The Big 5 personality traits model provides a framework to potentially understand how different individuals might perceive and be impacted by cancel culture. For instance: Examining cancel culture through the prism of personality traits potentially illuminates how different individuals react differently to this phenomenon and underscores the multifaceted nature of its impact on mental health. As this cultural practice continues to evolve, especially in diverse and politically-charged areas like Washington DC, a deeper understanding of its psychological underpinnings is crucial for promoting a healthier, more empathetic society. To fully grasp the intricacies of cancel culture, it’s valuable to explore it through the lens of various psychological theories. Concepts like Cognitive Dissonance, Groupthink, and Social Identity Theory may offer deeper insights into the dynamics at play. Additionally, cancel culture can act as a form of retribution and justice when the traditional justice system is ineffective. Cognitive Dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger, occurs when an individual’s beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors are in conflict. In cancel culture, this can manifest when someone’s actions or statements contradict their self-image or public persona, leading to a public outcry. This theory provides a hypothetical framework for why individuals might react defensively or with denial when confronted as they struggle to reconcile these inconsistencies in their identity, potentially exacerbating mental health problems. Groupthink, identified by psychologist Irving Janis, refers to the phenomenon where the desire for harmony or conformity in a group results in irrational or dysfunctional decision-making. In cancel culture, groupthink could amplify one-sided views, where dissenting opinions are suppressed for fear of being ostracized. This dynamic can contribute to a toxic environment where critical thinking is stifled, and mental health is impacted by the pressure to conform. Social Identity Theory, developed by Henri Tajfel and John Turner, posits that people derive part of their identity from their social groups. Cancel culture has been used to address allegations of sexual harassment, with high-profile cases like that of Roman Polanski illustrating the ongoing challenges in adequately addressing these issues. In cancel culture, this could lead to ‘us versus them’ dynamics, where individuals align strongly with the opinions and actions of their group, often to the detriment of understanding and empathy for the ‘out-group.’ This polarization can have profound effects on mental health, as it fosters environments of conflict and alienation. Cancel culture can have significant mental health implications, including anxiety, depression, and social isolation. To mitigate these harms, it is essential to develop strategies for promoting healthy online interactions and fostering a culture of empathy and understanding. Encouraging respectful and constructive dialogue, rather than resorting to personal attacks and insults, is crucial. Social media platforms can also play a role by implementing policies and guidelines that encourage respectful communication. By promoting healthy online interactions and fostering a culture of empathy and understanding, we can mitigate the harms of cancel culture and create a more inclusive and compassionate society. Promoting healthy online interactions is crucial for mitigating the harms of cancel culture. This can be achieved by encouraging individuals to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue, rather than resorting to personal attacks and insults. Social media platforms can also play a role in promoting healthy online interactions by implementing policies and guidelines that encourage respectful communication. By fostering a culture of empathy and understanding, we can create a more inclusive and compassionate society, mitigating the negative impacts of cancel culture on mental health and societal well-being. Cancel culture is a multifaceted phenomenon with far-reaching implications for mental health and societal well-being. Its impacts are complex and can vary greatly depending on individual personality traits, societal contexts, and the specific circumstances of each case. The psychological theories discussed provide valuable frameworks for understanding the underlying dynamics of cancel culture, including the roles of cognitive dissonance, groupthink, and social identity. Adopting compassionate and informed approaches is crucial in addressing the complexities of cancel culture. This involves fostering environments where open dialogue, education, and restorative practices are prioritized over punitive measures. Understanding the psychological underpinnings of cancel culture can aid in developing more empathetic and effective strategies for dealing with its impacts. While cancel culture can pose significant challenges to mental health and societal harmony, it also presents opportunities for growth and learning and promotes a more understanding and inclusive culture. By approaching this phenomenon with a balanced perspective and a commitment to compassionate action, we can navigate its challenges while fostering a healthier, more empathetic society.

Culture Ideology
https://www.aei.org/articles/the-dangerous-evolution-of-cancel-culture/,27-August-2024,The Dangerous Evolution of Cancel Culture,"By Samuel J. Abrams Minding the Campus August 27, 2024 Academic boycotts targeting ideas, individuals, and institutions deemed problematic are no longer just in vogue for faculty. This illiberal and anti-intellectual tactic has now been adopted by students—presumably taking a cue from faculty and administrators—to cancel faculty who hold views they disagree with. I encountered this personally during the most recent course interview week at Sarah Lawrence College, during which I learned that several groups—like the Sarah Lawrence Socialist Coalition and the Sarah Lawrence Review—decided that because I support Israel’s right to exist and to defend itself, my lectures will be corrupted and therefore should be boycotted. During interview week, professors hold Zoom sessions to discuss their course plans and engage with prospective students—a course-shopping practice that started during the pandemic. This year, several leftist students, intent on canceling me and boycotting my courses—I’m teaching classes on Polarization and Presidential Leadership—resorted to privately messaging many of the prospective students in my Zoom room. These factually inaccurate and deliberately provocative messages went unnoticed by me during the session, as I was focused on sharing syllabi and other course-related information. It wasn’t until after the session that one of the students who received a message showed it to me, and I became aware of the situation. The next day, my classes, which are typically oversubscribed with waitlists, were not full—a stark contrast, especially during an election year. The message—posted below—which falsely stated that I tweeted a comment conflating “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) advocates with Nazis, read: Screenshot of the message obtained by Minding the Campus Cancel culture, as we know it, mostly occurs through social media, which anyone with an internet connection can view. While that’s bad enough, this tactic of directly messaging students is a chilling evolution of cancel culture that threatens speech, expression, learning, and open inquiry. The culture of vocal, organized, and illiberal forces is now driving students away from courses these groups find objectionable. Unlike larger, more diffuse schools like Pace University or New York University, smaller residential schools like Sarah Lawrence College—where everyone knows everyone and reputations are critical—face amplified risks. When students are directly messaged about a boycott, it clearly signals that enrolling in my class could be risky. Such a culture is the antithesis of a true collegiate education. It is nearly impossible to stand against a mob that has declared someone persona non grata. While protesting a professor in the public sphere is one thing, directly targeting and approaching students through multiple channels raises the stakes, significantly increasing the intimidation for those who refuse to fall in line. These dynamics of coercion and forced behavior at a small college like Sarah Lawrence were painfully laid out by Interfaith leader Eboo Patel, who recounted the power and problem of groupthink in his experience at a 2019 “Difference in Dialogue” program on our campus. A student group called the Diaspora Coalition deliberately disrupted his event. Patel recalled, “Sixty students stood up as a collective, raised their fists in the air, and declared that they were taking over the space. One by one, they began reading statements of protest from their smartphones. Each statement followed the same formula.” Patel spoke with some students after the disrupted program and documented a far too common trend, particularly on the left: a tendency to demand ideological purity, forcing the community into conformity and self-censorship. One student protestor told Patel that the Diaspora Coalition did not fully represent her in both substance and style and that in her attempts to support minority identities, she had been led to take part in “things that violate [her] own identity, including rudeness to teachers and other educational leaders.” When Patel asked her why a student would support the Diaspora Coalition’s manifesto even if they did not feel correctly represented, the student said there “was a strong culture of talking about minority identities on campus … but only in ways that emphasized one’s marginalization. And there was a palpable fear of breaking the mold.” Moreover, students who challenged or questioned the approach “risked being ‘Sarah Lawrenced’ — a particular form of cancellation on the college campus.” It’s hard to imagine a clearer sign of a broken campus culture than simply using the college’s name to refer to efforts to cancel and silence students. Yet Patel’s chronicle of the fear of cancellation is not unique to Sarah Lawrence. Numerous reports have found that students are afraid to challenge their peers due to reputational consequences, and these dynamics are being exploited by the Socialist Coalition at Sarah Lawrence. What is notable, too, is that while this case is on the ideological left, it’s not just conservative students who feel compelled to keep quiet, either. Leftists and moderates also feel bullied and threatened into silence. Students of all persuasions censor themselves out of concern not just for their reputation but their grades as well. Another powerful and devastating illustration of these forces was just revealed at Haverford College. As a prospective student explained: ‘First, [I] had some great conversations with other students, but when they hear that I went to Jewish Day School and am a Jew, I get asked almost immediately if I support Israel, and if I’m Zionist, I either get blocked or ridiculed by other Haverford students who I barely even know.’ The social dynamics at Haverford are almost identical to that of Sarah Lawrence, where a professor described the situation on the Haverford campus as follows: ‘The social pressures on students here are just tremendous. And to hear stories from students, where people they thought were their friends, telling them that because they are Zionist, which means believing, just believing, in Israel’s right to exist, is a huge part of our identity… [they say] ‘I will not be your friend. We cannot be in connection. You got to reject that part of your identity.’ Now imagine if that kind of pressure on gays [or] students of color. However, that [antisemitism] seems to be completely socially acceptable among the students.’ After the tragic events of October 7th and the brutal killing and kidnapping by Hamas of many Israelis—some of whom remain in captivity—Sarah Lawrence College president  Cristle Collins Judd did state that “there is not, nor can there be, any place for antisemitism or hate speech of any kind on our campus.” Despite this pronouncement by the head of the College, almost nothing has been done institutionally to address the hatred toward Jews, and the school is consequently facing a federal Title VI case involving its  “persistent and pervasive” anti-Semitism. The ‘pervasive’ anti-Semitism at Sarah Lawrence is once again on full display, with students attempting to boycott me for my personal views about Israel—views that are deeply rooted in my faith and heritage. These actions not only harm students by stifling their ability to ask questions but also diminish their overall educational experience. All the while, such attacks and views among those on the Sarah Lawrence campus are not shared by many elsewhere. A majority of Americans support Israel’s right to self-defense. Vice President Kamala Harris announced that she “will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself and … will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself,” noting that Israelis should “never again” go through the horror and “unspeakable” attacks of October 7th. Former President Trump likewise has supported Israel’s fight against Hamas. Despite the misguided and extreme views held by the students who attempted to cancel me for being a Zionist Jew, what has occurred at Sarah Lawrence represents a serious threat to college students and to the broader concept of viewpoint diversity. Students can inflict actual harm on their peers by depriving them of opportunities to learn and explore and by destroying their chances of gaining a liberal education. This will be a real challenge to combat and will be harder to address than simply breaking up illegal demonstrations and stopping organized violence. It requires changing the hearts and minds of students through a cultural shift towards real tolerance that may be impossible given the political activism and anti-Semitism preferred by so many faculty and administrators, permeating everything from dining halls to dorms along with campus centers and faculty offices. However, higher education must take this challenge seriously if it is to survive and fulfill its liberal mission of helping all students find the truth, explore openly, and question without fear or threat.",samuel abram mind campu august academ boycott target idea individu institut deem problemat vogu faculti illiber anti intellectu tactic adopt student take cue faculti administr cancel faculti hold view disagre encount person recent interview week sarah lawrenc colleg learn sarah lawrenc socialist coalit sarah lawrenc review decid support israel exist defend lectur corrupt boycott interview week professor hold zoom session discuss plan engag prospect student shop practic start pandem leftist student intent cancel boycott cours teach class polar presidenti leadership resort privat messag prospect student zoom factual inaccur deliber provoc messag unnot session focu share syllabu relat inform wasn session student receiv messag awar situat dai class typic oversubscrib waitlist stark contrast elect messag post fals state tweet comment conflat divers equiti inclus dei advoc nazi rea tongu stick screenshot messag obtain mind campu cancel cultur occur social medium internet connect view bad tactic directli messag student chill evolut cancel cultur threaten speech tongu stick ression learn inquiri cultur vocal organ illiber forc drive student cours objection unlik larg diffus school pace univers york univers residenti school sarah lawrenc colleg reput critic amplifi risk student directli messag boycott signal enrol class riski cultur antithesi true collegi educ imposs stand mob declar persona grata protest professor public sphere directli target approach student multipl channel rais stake significantli increas intimid refus fall line dynam coercion forc behavior colleg sarah lawrenc painfulli lai interfaith leader eboo patel recount power groupthink tongu stick erienc differ dialogu program campu student call diaspora coalit deliber disrupt event patel recal sixti student stand collect rais fist air declar take space read statement protest smartphon statement formula patel speak student disrupt program document common trend leav tendenc demand ideolog puriti forc commun conform censorship student protestor tell patel diaspora coalit repres substanc style attempt support minor ident lead violat ident includ rude teacher educ leader patel student support diaspora coalit manifesto feel correctli repres student strong cultur talk minor ident campu emphas margin palpabl fear break mold student challeng question approach risk sarah lawrenc form cancel colleg campu hard imagin clear sign break campu cultur simpli colleg refer effort cancel silenc student patel chronicl fear cancel uniqu sarah lawrenc numer report find student afraid challeng peer due reput consequ dynam tongu stick loit socialist coalit sarah lawrenc notabl ideolog leav conserv student feel compel quiet leftist moder feel bulli threaten silenc student persuas censor concern reput grade power devast illustr forc reveal haverford colleg prospect student tongu stick lain tongu stick convers student hear jewish dai school jew immedi support israel zionist block ridicul haverford student bare social dynam haverford ident sarah lawrenc professor situat haverford campu social pressur student tremend hear stori student peopl friend tell zionist mean believ believ israel exist huge ident friend connect reject ident imagin pressur gai student color antisemit complet social accept student tragic event octob brutal kill kidnap hama isra remain captiv sarah lawrenc colleg presid cristl collin judd antisemit hate speech campu pronounc head colleg institution address hatr jew school face feder titl involv persist pervas anti semit pervas anti semit sarah lawrenc displai student attempt boycott person view israel view deepli root faith heritag action harm student stifl abil question diminish educ tongu stick erienc attack view sarah lawrenc campu share major american support israel defens vice presid kamala harri announc stand israel defend ensur israel abil defend note isra horror unspeak attack octob presid trump likewis support israel fight hama misguid extrem view hold student attempt cancel zionist jew occur sarah lawrenc repres threat colleg student broad concept viewpoint divers student inflict actual harm peer depriv opportun learn tongu stick lore destroi chanc gain liber educ real challeng combat hard address simpli break illeg demonstr stop organ violenc requir chang heart mind student cultur shift real toler imposs polit activ anti semit prefer faculti administr permeat dine hall dorm campu center faculti offic educ challeng surviv fulfil liber mission help student truth tongu stick lore openli question fear threat,14,4,0.20835844886477797,0.06067912397026322,0.046614426361261806,0.48262005224030546,0.05364677516576251,0.09302792847096644,0.05505324492666265,14,"Activism, Law & Social Movements"
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/asia/cancel-culture-law-singapore-intl-hnk,12-May-2023,A law that cancels cancel culture? This country is considering it,"Cancel culture, the online trend of calling out people, celebrities, brands and organizations a?? rightly or wrongly a?? for perceived social indiscretions or offensive behaviors, has become a polarizing topic of debate. To some, ita??s an important means of social justice and holding powerful figures to account. But to others, ita??s often a??misused and misdirecteda?? and has become a form of mob rule. But one country wants to put an end to the deeply contested online phenomena by introducing what legal experts and observers say would be the worlda??s first law against cancel culture a?? raising alarm among rights activists who fear that such legal powers could be used to stifle free speech. Over the past year, Singaporea??s government has been a??looking at ways to deal with cancel culture,a?? a spokesperson told CNN a?? amid what some say is a brewing culture war between gay rights supporters and the religious right following the recent decriminalization of homosexuality in the largely conservative city-state. Authorities said they were a??examining existing related laws and legislationa?? after receiving a??feedbacka?? from conservative Christians who expressed fears about being canceled for their views by vocal groups online. a??People ought to be free to express their views without fear of being attacked on both sides,a?? law minister K Shanmugam said in an interview with state media outlets in August. Related article Why Singapore's gay sex law change is a double-edged sword for LGBTQ activists a??We should not allow a culture where people of religion are ostracized (or) attacked for espousing their views or their disagreements with LGBT viewpoints a?? and vice versa,a?? he added. His comments came ahead of the historic repealing of a colonial-era law that criminalized gay sex a?? even if it was consensual. a??We cannot sit by and do nothing. We have to look at the right boundaries between hate speech and free speech in this context,a?? Shanmugam said. a??There could be wider repercussions for society at large where public discourse becomes impoverisheda?| so we plan to do something about this.a?? In a statement to CNN, his law ministry said the impact of online cancel campaigns could be a??far reaching and severe for victims.a?? a??(Some) have been unable to engage in reasonable public discourse for fear of being attacked for their views onlinea?| and may engage in self censorship for fear of being made a target of cancel campaigns,a?? a ministry spokesperson said. The first thing any law tackling cancel culture must do, would be to define the act of canceling a?? an extremely complex challenge according to legal experts, given how contentious cancel culture can be. The phrase first originated from the slang term a??cancel,a?? referring to breaking up with someone, according to the Pew Research Center, and later gained traction on social media. The Center published a study around the cancel phenomenon in 2021 which revealed deep public division across demographic groups in the United States a?? from the very meaning of the phrase as well as what cancel culture represents. According to Eugene Tan, an associate law professor from the Singapore Management University (SMU), there remains a??no accepted definitiona?? of canceling and as such, any proposed law would have to be a??very clearly defined and worded.a?? a??What does it mean when a person claims to be canceled? How would alleged victims show proof of being canceled?a?? said Tan, who once served as a nominated member of the Singapore Parliament. a??All too often, incidents are interpreted, described or remembered by people in different ways. The lack of precision could result in the law being over inclusive, covering acts which it shouldna??t,a?? added Tan. a??But if the definition is limiting, the law could be under inclusive and not cover crucial acts when it should,a?? said Tan. Given how most cancel cases take place online, the new law would also have to be specially drafted with the internet in mind and likely involve cooperation from social media giants, lawyers in Singapore told CNN. a??A cancel law will have to involve the platforms on which people typically discuss or propagate anything related to cancellation and where materials are published,a?? said Ian Ernst Chai, a lawyer who once served as a deputy public prosecutor in Singaporea??s Attorney Generala??s Chambers. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok could possibly be asked to police users or comply with court orders to a certain extent, Chai said a?? and this could also include taking down posts and tweets deemed to be a??in infringement of the law.a?? Related article Chris Rock tackles 'selective outrage' and Oscars slap in live Netflix special Special legal mechanisms would also be needed to identify perpetrators (a??cancelersa??), said other legal experts. a??With cancel culture, things can spread immediately online and peoplea??s reputations can be ruined in a matter of hours,a?? said criminal lawyer Joshua Tong. a??It is clear that traditional legal processes are not suitable for cancel scenarios and a different process must be used. The (new) law could contain sections like intervention mechanisms to stop cancel campaigns before they gather steam,a?? added Tong. In Singaporea??s case, there are also already several laws governing the internet which include an anti fake news bill a?? punishable with fines of up to 50,000 Singapore dollars ($38,000) or possible prison sentences of up to five years a?? as well as laws governing cyberbullying and doxing. So a cancel law would have to be one thata??s very distinct in nature. The drafting of new laws could take months or even years and would have to be passed in Parliament, Singapore legal experts said. While the government did not provide further details when asked about what a new law dealing with cancel culture would look like or when it could be expected a?? critics have raised concerns over what they say could result in further restrictions on freedom of speech and expression in Singapore. a??It sounds like yet another intimidation tactic by the government against those on the ground trying to raise their voices to demand accountability and change,a?? said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch. a??If a person or a group says hateful and discriminatory things against gay and trans people for example, others should be allowed to call them out and rebut what was said a?? this isna??t a??cancel culturea??, ita??s social discourse and any modern, democratic society should be able to handle that without overbearing state interference.a?? Related article Cancel culture is about power -- who has it and who wants to be heard Free speech advocate Roy Ngerng said a law against cancel culture would be a??dangerous.a?? In 2015, Ngerng was sued for defamation by the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong over a critical blog post he had written about the countrya??s national pensions plan. Ngerng lost his job at a national hospital as a result and said he was also harassed online. a??The governmenta??s strategy has been systematic from the beginning a?? canceling people like activists, journalists and opposition politicians who they deem disagreeable,a?? he told CNN. a??They have adapted laws for use during the Internet era and perhaps seeing how fast conversations move on social media has prompted them to create a new law to stamp out cancel culture a?? prevent conversations from moving too quickly,a?? he said. a??We shouldna??t be worried about conversations being canceled a?? we should be more worried about the government coming up with new laws and ways to cancel Singaporeans.a??

https://www.enzuzo.com/blog/cancel-culture-examples,17-June-2024,23 Cancel Culture Examples: Brands That Have Been Cancelled,"When it comes to cancel culture, the court of public opinion still reigns supreme. With the rise of social media (and our increasing expectation for businesses and service providers to reflect the values that we hold dear), brands have never been under more scrutiny to do, say and sell the right thing. Brands can be canceled for several reasons, which we'll discuss later in this article. One of them is data privacy breaches (such as Facebook's scandals)-as a start, we encourage companies to be very transparent about the data they collect and what they do with it. What exactly is meant by a brand being ""canceled."" An offshoot of the call-out culture that spread with the rise of movements such as the #MeToo campaign, the phrase ""to be canceled"" refers to the brand or person in question being entirely boycotted and ostracized, with all public support being withdrawn. Typically (and somewhat ironically), a good deal of social media attention tends to accompany a brand experiencing cancellation. Hashtags involving the brand name and a demand for them to be canceled will commonly crop up, and this is often how campaigns encouraging their boycott will be spread. Of course, it's rare for a brand to fail following cancellation truly, but these situations still require careful navigation and a well-thought-through response. In this article, we'll explore a few of the brands who've come through this form of crisis; look at a few of the ways you can respond if your own brand experiences a backlash of this nature. Most importantly, we'll set out a few ways to help avoid the problem altogether. Cancel culture is starting to experience something of a backlash. Even former US President, Barack Obama, has come out against the social trend in a speech given in support of the Obama Foundation - ""That is not activism, that is not bringing about change. The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws."" But even with the tide starting to turn, plenty of brands have still experienced this form of backlash in recent years. Commonly, a cancellation will accompany an accusation of hypocrisy. With cause marketing forming such a core component of many modern brands' promotional strategies, the public are swift to pick up upon a mismatch in terms of messaging here. In the wake of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, many brands were eager to position themselves as allies, with campaigns built around their commitment to racial equality. However, this backfired for many, including Urban Outfitters, who were immediately called out on their problematic past associations with cultural appropriation. Also, many past employees of companies continue to speak out on discriminatory or racist experiences they had while working at certain companies. In 2020, Reformation came under fire, and promised to make change in their organization after acknowledging their wrongdoings. Another common cause for cancellation are the actions of a board member or stakeholder. In 2011, GoDaddy's founder Bob Parsons, videotaped himself shooting an African elephant and posing with its body. The public outcry was instant, and his unapologetic stance, coupled with the company's hugely unpopular support for the Stop Online Piracy Act, saw the hosting company lose 70,000 domains in a single week. Bob Parsons stepped down from the board in 2018. Brands that fail to adapt their branding to meet modern standards can also come up against big problems. Many businesses that have benefited from tired and insensitive stereotypes, either for their naming or representation, have had to rethink how they position their offering to an increasingly enlightened, modern audience. In the USA, a famous syrup brand, Aunt Jemima's, was ""cancelled"" - swiftly followed by its partner in crime, Mrs. Butterworth's pancake mix. Balenciaga made global headlines for the wrong reasons for its Balenciaga Gift Shop campaign, featuring images of children with the brand's handbags that looked like teddy bears in bondage gear. Other ads in the campaign featured images of a Supreme Court ruling against child porn, suggesting that the brand opposed the judgement. Needless to say that members of society were outraged. Long-time Balenciaga model Kim Kardashian said she would be ""re-evaluating her work with the company"" and several other fashion industry executives indicated their displeasure. Kanye West (also known as Ye) is no stranger to controversy. However, he's been on the receiving end of some extremely negative press coverage since the past few months, starting from his decision to wear a ""white lives matter"" t-shirt at a fashion event in Paris. Ye's comments, including his praise of former U.S. president Trump, has caused him to lose deals with Gap, Adidas, and Balenciaga, making him one of the most cancelled celebrities of 2022. Cancel culture often gets depicted as an overreaction to a brand or individual. But often enough, a brand, celebrity, or well-known entity finds itself in the crosshairs for not being mindful of how its views square up against its target audience. A great example of this is Goya. Known as one of the largest Hispanic-owned food brands in the United States, the company has a deep portfolio of offerings ranging from spices and candies to pantry essentials like beans and empanada wraps. The CEO, Robert Unanue found himself in hot water in 2020 when at a presidential reception he shared that the nation was ""truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump."" However, given the Trump administration's oftentimes adversarial stance towards the Latinx and Hispanic communities, the speech didn't go over well. Calls for #BoycottGoya and #Goyaway began to trend on social media as consumers began advocating for finding alternative brands to buy household essentials. The outcry was later picked up by advocacy groups like United We Dream and United Farm Workers. While Goya's bottom line wasn't impacted in the long term, its CEO Unanue probably learned that he should be more mindful of what he says - especially if his political views are unlikely to follow those of many of his customers. Tampax is a staple for many women as a go-to solution for feminine products. The brand made a massive faux paus in 2022 when a glib tweet immediately received backlash. The trending hashtag #BoycottTampax emerged after the tampon brand released a tweet saying ""You're in their DMs. We're in them. We're not the same."" Tampax was accused of sexualizing tampons. While the brand later deleted the tweet and issued a mea culpa, the cancel movement took on a life of its own in a new direction. Anti-trans commenters picked up the hashtag and used the moment to rail against the company's decision to use transgender people in its advertising. New Yorkers are incredibly vocal citizens. And one thing any real New Yorker will tell you is that they don't want the Olympics or Amazon coming to their city. In a city of over 8 million people that have to share cramped and overpriced housing, when big business eyes the city that never sleeps, they get weary. In 2018, Amazon publicly announced its interest to move the company headquarters to two new cities, one of which would be New York. Citizens and local politicians were none too pleased given Amazon's anti-union stance and ability to squeeze out mom-and-pop sellers. More importantly, opposition to the potential tax credits the conglomerate would receive from the city and state, as well as the risk of further raising already sky-high housing costs weighed heavily on people's minds. Eventually, Amazon scrapped its New York expansion plans in 2019. Oftentimes, cancel culture arises because the boardroom lacks diversity. If you don't have diverse voices during the development stages, you end up creating campaigns and messaging that miss the mark. Or more often than not, you create imagery or wording that overlooks what would be considered obvious red flags to people from marginalized groups. Heineken can attest to this thanks to a 2018 ad to promote the brand's new light beer. The video clip shows a beer sliding down a bar. As it makes its way, it passes several darker-skinned patrons until it stops in front of a visibly lighter customer. The slogan ""lighter is better"" is shown on the screen. After being accused of overt racism by many - including celebrity Chance the Rapper - the brand pulled the ad and issued an apology. But, it does make you wonder how many people in the internal departments viewed this ad and approved it before it was released to the public. Apple has a storied history of creating products that consumers love, but then those items not living up to expectations. On more than one occasion, the tech giant has found itself under investigation for knowingly allowing faulty devices to exist - and not offering restitution to its customers. In 2017, Apple confirmed what consumers had long suspected, that certain products began to purposely work less efficiently as they aged. The brand admitted that it intentionally slowed down older iPhones under the guise of trying to protect the phone. Along with a big apology, the brand also offered battery replacements at a reduced price of $29 rather than the standard $49. If you're an elder Gen Z'er or older, you are probably familiar with the actor Charlie Sheen. He's been a fixture for many people since the 80s and is one-third of the famous Sheen/Estevez crew (the others being his father Martin Sheen and brother Emilio Estevez). Sheen is no stranger to drama and has had his name in the papers on more than one occasion. But in 2011, things took a turn when several widely reported interviews he granted - including to the controversial Alex Jones - left him looking like an unhinged man. Highlights included memorable lines like ""winning"", claiming that he used tiger blood, and using inflammatory language to describe show creator Chuck Lorre. The actor drove his career off a cliff in a matter of a few days. Not long after, he was let go from his contract with Two and a Half Men on CBS when he was the highest-paid actor on episodic television and was later checked in for drug addiction treatment. If you're familiar with Rosanne Barr, you know that she's no stranger to controversy as her career has been highlighted by it. From screeching the National Anthem at a San Diego Padres game to generally being at odds with the mainstream, she's made a career out of ruffling some feathers. However, she ruffled one feather too many in 2018 when she took to Twitter to voice her displeasure in a racist tweet that compared former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett (a Black woman) to an ape. As a half-hearted mea culpa, she blamed her racist rant on taking too many Ambien - prompting the pharmaceutical producer, Sanofi, to publicly state that ""racism is not a known side effect"" of taking their drug. ABC swiftly kicked her off of the wildly popular Rosanne reboot, paused the show, and retooled it as The Conners. To explain her absence, they killed off her character in an opioid drug overdose. Cancel culture has technically been around forever, it's just that now it has a name. While most cancellations occur because of prior bad acts, sometimes a brand just doesn't understand what their customer wants and a new release goes poorly - very poorly. In 1985, Coca-Cola was in a neck-and-neck fight with Pepsi and they wanted to finally come out on top. The brand launched ""New Coke"", a new formulation of the company's classic recipe which hadn't been changed in 99 years. Unfortunately, people hated the drink and the ""New Coke"" campaign is considered one of the biggest marketing flops in corporate history. Consumers wrote and called into the brand, doing everything possible to make it clear that under no uncertain terms should Coca-Cola continue to produce ""New Coke"". The ""New Coke"" campaign flopped and by July 1985, Coca-Cola Classic was back on the shelves. More importantly, New Coke - or Coke II as it was renamed - didn't make it to 1986. You can't be a company that prioritizes privacy and data protection and have a cancel culture roundup that doesn't feature Facebook. Whether you want to call them Meta or Facebook, the social media behemoth has routinely found itself at the center of controversy over the way it handles user data. More recent dramas such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal during the 2016 presidential election cycle are still fresh in everyone's minds. But in 2019, a separate entity blew the whistle on yet another data breach at Facebook. Third-party apps that were linked with Facebook had exposed millions of user data on the internet. The social giant found itself slapped with a $5 billion fine by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and had its net worth drop by $37 billion. Did Facebook really get canceled because of this? No. Would villainizing Facebook for the way it handles consumer data be considered ""woke-ism"" going too far? Again, no. However, it did once again highlight why privacy laws matter and why businesses have a responsibility to be careful with consumer data. For the most part, Dove is as vanilla of a brand as you can get in the U.S. This sensitive skin-safe brand is all about keeping your body hydrated and protected. Likewise, Dove is firmly behind The Crown Act to aid in ending racially driven discrimination based on the way a person wears their hair. However, even a brand as do-gooder as Dove can step into it from time to time. In 2017, the brand released a digital commercial for social media to promote its body wash. In the short clip, people are seen changing their shirts and morphing into different people. In a three-second clip that will haunt the editor for the rest of their lives, a visibly darker-skinned Black woman takes off her shirt and is immediately replaced by a white woman who's also removing the same color shirt as the Black woman. In news that shocks no one, this didn't go over well and the brand was slapped with accusations of racism. If the outrage went over your head, consider that the ad was for a body wash that was meant to cleanse your skin of dirt. And the ad shows a dark-skinned person transforming or cleansing themselves to become a white person. Of course, the clip was pulled and apologies were issued, but it's safe to assume that Dove doesn't want to take a trip down the 2017 memory lane any time soon. More than likely, you've probably seen a Wonderful Company commercial. From Fiji Water to Pom Wonderful, Wonderful Pistachios, and more, this company is the backer for some of the most popular trending food brands. Based in California, the company produces pistachios, pomegranates, almonds, grapefruit, and naval oranges. So, what's the problem? Many of the company's farms are located in areas that are struggling with water scarcity. While people who live in the areas scrounge to find sufficient drinking water, Wonderful's farms continue to use water with abandoned - even during notorious California drought seasons. The company is owned by a power couple - Lynda and Stewart Resnick - who leveraged controversial political backroom dealings to negotiate water rights and maneuver around state water regulations to siphon water and keep their farms thriving even during low water times. As of 2016, the Resnik's agricultural empire has been reported to use more water than all Los Angeles residents combined. To date, there's a growing backlash with many people refusing to purchase Wonderful Company products. This is because many low-income individuals who live near and work in the Wonderful Company's farms have to pay to have water shipped in since they can't access the water that naturally flows through the land. Iconic beer brand Bud Light has taken a beating recently after consumers vehemently protested its decision to partner with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney. A slew of social media posts, including one from musician Kid Rock, show folks refusing to consume the beverage or tossing it in the garbage. Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of Bud Light, had to cancel a scheduled event after fears that its employees might be targeted. The controversy has had a knock-off impact on the company's stock, too, with its price declining by 3% after the news first broke. Superbad actor Jonah Hill was accused by his ex-girlfriend Sarah Brady of a slew of misogynistic text messages and emotional gaslighting. The surfer and model shared screenshots of Hill's messages on her Instagram page which allegedly asked Brady to ""respect his boundaries"" and to stop participating in surfing contests. Hill has not commented on the posts so far but has attracted plenty of criticism for his aggressive messages. JK Rowling and the Harry Potter universe once seemed like cultural touchstones that could do no wrong. The beloved series of books connected with readers of all ages and sparked a massive shift in the fantasy zeitgeist that we're still feeling today. Unfortunately, these days, Rowling's name is synonymous with more than just the wizarding world. The controversy kicked off in 2020 when Rowling tweeted disdain for news outlets using the term ""people who menstruate"" rather than ""women."" This was one of the first public signs of Rowling's proclivities on trans-related issues, and in years since, she has doubled and tripled down with more tweets, arguments, and essays sharing claims about the role of trans people in society. Rowling's positions sent shockwaves through sections of the Harry Potter fandom, placing increased scrutiny on details from the series as well as boycotts against the franchise's new media releases. Who doesn't love pumpkin spice? This unique spice blend is an iconic holiday tradition for those in the United States. We put it in everything, from drinks to pastries to body wash. This innocuous spice mix would seem to be an unassailable cultural mainstay, but in 2023, The Washington Post published a hit piece against pumpkin spice and its violent origins. The article details the history of how pumpkin spice came to be, noting the colonizer history behind the spice trade and the bloody details that brought us our modern use of nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon. It was a dark tale to tell for something as festive as pumpkin spice, and it raised a critical question in the consumer mainstream: Can a flavor be canceled? While some called for boycotts of the popular spice, others mocked the notion as being the worst example of runaway cancel culture. While pumpkin spice sales have been declining in recent years, the market for pumpkin spice products remains at an impressive $800M+. Those familiar with country music will be well-acquainted with The Dixie Chicks and their 2003 controversy. Once one a household name in the 90's country scene, the band became embroiled in controversy during a 2003 London performance in which the lead singer, Natalie Maines, commented that she was ashamed to be from the same state as then-President George W. Bush. The comment was an indictment of the impending invasion of Iraq-a hot button political issue of the time. The comment didn't sit well with the band's fanbase, many of whom were politically conservative and felt betrayed by the band's lack of perceived patriotism. The comments led to a massive boycott of the Dixie Chicks, with stores pulling their records from shelves and radio stations omitting their hits from popular music playlists. While Natalie Maines quickly apologized for the comments, the group held firm in its convictions over time-even repeating the same comment at a concert years later. This controversy marked a significant shift in The Dixie Chicks' evolution and created widespread discourse on the nature of celebrity voices and what responsibilities, if any, artists have to their audiences. First published in 1989, comic readers need no introduction to ""Dilbert"" or the comic's skewering of modern American work culture. But in 2023, the comic's author, Scott Adams, came under fire for posting a profanity-laden rant on YouTube, commenting that Black Americans are a ""hate group"", among other claims. This wasn't the first time Scott Adams received backlash for his charged political commentary, but it'd be the most significant. Within days, publication groups like USA TODAY Network and Advance Local Group had dropped the strip from publication, followed closely by many other outlets in the following weeks. Almost overnight, ""Dilbert"" had gone from circulation in over 2,000 newspapers to virtually none, and the comic would cease print publication soon after. Popular YouTube creator Ms Rachel, who runs a channel aimed at babies and young kids, is facing heat from conservative parents after she posted a video celebrating Pride month. Ms Rachel, who's real name is Rachel Griffin Accurso, said she's ""not chasing fame or views"" but rather ""standing strong in love,"" in response to conservative commentators who said she goes against traditional values. Ms Rachel has felt the heat before, too. In March 2023 she announced a break from social media after adding a non-binary co-star to her YouTube channel. If you find your brand at the heart of a ""cancel culture"" type campaign, you need to turn to a crisis PR strategy. Transparency and humility are your best hope for survival regarding the messaging you put out in response. Address the accusations head-on. If you feel that you have misstepped and that an apology is appropriate, make it honest and unequivocal. Couple this apology with some tangible change or action. It's imperative that this isn't seen as a token gesture, put out to appease the baying mob. A single advertisement campaign centered around the issue will only make matters worse if it's followed by more problematic content that lapses back into the behaviours you've been called out for. Show how you're making bigger, more systemic or operational changes to ensure the wrong is righted (and more importantly, that it won't happen again.) You don't need to see cancellation as the end of your brand, but you should take it as a wake-up call. The good news is the chances of your brand ""being cancelled"" are reducing. Cancel culture sparked by moral outrage is starting to fall out of favour. People would rather see a brand acknowledge its failings and put things right. Lessons learnt seem to be more valuable than the message that a brand is instantly going out of business. However, there are other ways that a brand can fall foul of its audience, and you may find the public to be much less forgiving or flexible in their reaction in these cases. Issues arising from mishandling data related to payments or personal information are a cardinal sin to the modern-day consumer.

https://gettysburgian.com/2023/11/canceled-or-popularized-the-rise-of-cancel-culture/,08-November-2023,Canceled or Popularized: The Rise of Cancel Culture,"Posted By Kenzie Smith on Nov 8, 2023 | 0 comments By Kenzie Smith, Arts & Entertainment Editor Any pop-culture enthusiast is familiar with the effects of cancel culture as there are endless social media posts and news articles on it. Cancel culture occurs when celebrities or other public figures participate in behaviors that are viewed unfavorable by the general public. This often causes a mass of people to publicly withdraw their support of the individual and call for others to do the same. Social media has allowed for cancel culture to upsurge and spread at a quicker rate. This implication has both positive and negative aspects. There are times when cancel culture works to decrease support of individuals who have been proven to partake in behaviors and ideas that are harmful to society, such as Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and Matty Healy due to their anti semitic views. Social media allows for this information to spread quickly and gather more support. Some people, though, do not believe canceling an artist works as it is intended. People argue that cancel culture creates an environment of harassment and intolerance. There are also arguments that it is not productive as the most it can do is promote shame of the individual rather than accountability. An example of cancel culture taking it too far is an instance between James Corden and the k-pop band BTS. BTS has a very loyal fanbase called ARMY, and in 2021, Corden made jokes that ARMY did not like. These jokes were about BTS' fanbase being 15-year-old girls and calling BTS ""unusual visitors"" at the UN General Assembly. These jokes led to ARMY taking to social media platforms such as X to criticize Corden. In a later interview with BTS, where Corden apologized for the jokes, he mentioned that people had told him they hoped he would die. Death threats in response to some possibly ill-thought-out jokes is excessive, but this example is not an outlier. Oftentimes celebrities and public figures receive death threats from people who do not agree with them. When cancel culture is used improperly, it breeds dangerous environments of hostility and violence that do not always match the weight of the controversy. Although the backlash Corden received resulted in an apology to BTS, this progression is not always the case. Many times when celebrities are canceled, they are still participating in the behaviors or believing in the condemned ideas. Even though these celebrities are receiving mass criticism, they still remain popular. It can be argued that they sometimes receive even more attention from being the center of a controversy. Matt Healy is still on tour with his band, The 1975, even though he holds anti semitic views. Ye continuously has news articles and social media outlets highlighting his most recent actions. Another artist who has found herself facing cancel culture that is perhaps making her more popular is Doja Cat. The controversies surrounding Doja go back to 2015 where she released a song titled after a racist slur. She apologized for the use of the title but also said that she had chosen the title to reclaim the term that had been used against her in chat rooms. Other controversies surrounding Doja are her participation in chat rooms catered for incels and white supremacists, affiliation with streamer and musician J. Cyrus, the mocking of her fans and most recently, wearing a shirt that pictured alt-right YouTuber Sam Hyde. Although there has been an uproar on TikTok to cancel Doja Cat, she still has many fans and will be starting ""The Scarlet Tour"" on Oct. 31. Cancel culture creates questions about its productivity and intent, such as what actions dictate canceling celebrities, and is the process a productive method or does it just cultivate a hostile environment? Cancel culture may work as a way to spread information on the questionable decisions and ideologies of public figures, but it is not enough to hold them accountable. This facet begs the question of what options exist to hold celebrities accountable, or in our society does fame cause people to transcend accountability?

https://desktime.com/blog/cancel-culture-in-the-workplace,15-August-2022,Cancel culture in the workplace & what to do if you’ve fallen victim,"Cancel culture has made its way into the workplace. For those unfamiliar with the term, canceling someone typically consists of a group publicly shaming an individual, followed by the refusal to engage with that person in any capacity. Or, in layman’s terms, collectively not talking or working with someone because they’ve done or said something unacceptable. There can be several reasons for it: some unwelcome behavior or information coming to light, a clash in social or political views, or simply a personal disagreement that gets out of hand.

On one hand, canceling someone is an effective way to condemn bad deeds. It’s a form of social justice with a group taking charge in deeming something, e.g. sexual misconduct, beyond reprehensible and punishing the wrongdoer by shunning them from their community. Particularly when existing institutions and mechanisms fail to do so. On the other hand, it’s a very dangerous tool that can be easily misused, especially in a corporate environment. Hurtful office rumors can easily balloon into something more sinister, personal grudges can be weaponized, and differences in opinion can lead to mobbing. Oftentimes – unfairly. Cancel culture at work isn’t normal. There should always be mechanisms in place to resolve conflicts. When such procedures are lacking or insufficient, people tend to take matters into their own hands leading to a toxic and confrontational work environment. This negatively impacts office dynamics and puts a great deal of stress on employees. The target of the canceling in particular, as they’re made brutally aware that they’re not welcome. In turn, fruitful work and collaboration become virtually impossible for the affected individual and they often have no other alternative than to leave their company. Sometimes, this can bring about a positive overall result. One bad apple can spoil the bunch and teams would rather get rid of the person so they don’t have to perform in an environment with lingering hostility (assuming accusations are justified). In certain scenarios, canceling an individual may seem like the only option when that person, for example, is the manager who rejects and blocks different attempts at conflict resolution. Other times, and perhaps more commonly, cancel culture at work surfaces in the context of power plays or personal grudges. Making accusations toward a colleague because you don’t like them and then turning the rest of the team against them is a common way to solidify your own status and position in the organization. This can have long lasting effects on the target, particularly when the accusations are exaggerated or unfair. The target finds themselves alone in a hostile environment through little-to-no fault of their own and this can dramatically affect their mental health and professional performance. Moreover, the broader team and company is likely to only hear one side of the story, which makes it difficult to clear the air unless the instigator publicly apologizes or the situation is resolved through established channels. Once things are in motion, it’s difficult to reverse course. If you’ve fallen victim to a canceling, it doesn’t really matter if you’re at fault, or if it’s an unfair accusation that got way out of hand. In either case, the result will be the same – people will distance themselves from you and it will become difficult to go about your business like before. Other than toughing it out, which is hardly a healthy approach, a victim of a cancellation has three practical options: to try to clear the air, to talk with management, or to call it quits and look for another job. Being canceled is like being the subject of a rumor that has gotten way out of control. Oftentimes, many of the colleagues who now refuse to work with you have only heard one small part of one side of the story. Accordingly, if you’ve been treated unfairly, then the best route to take is to get your perspective out there. An email, a Slack message, or just talking with people when you have the opportunity – make sure you clearly get across the points you feel are important. Don’t hesitate to explain why you acted a certain way, and, if there’s any fault on your end, to apologize. As mentioned previously, there should always be company procedures in place to resolve conflict. Be it a HR person, a manager, or some digital reporting system, make use of the tools at your disposal to ameliorate the situation. Discuss the situation and work together to craft the best path forward. A cancel culture in the workplace isn’t healthy for anyone and management should always be interested in not only resolving issues, but also stomping out any embers. In cases where it’s the managers perpetrating or participating in the canceling, then, when possible, it should be taken up with people further up the chain of command before your direct superiors let you go due to personal reasons. It’s the extreme option, but if the situation has gotten extremely toxic and you can neither clear the air, nor escalate things with higher ups, then it might make sense to jump ship. If your work environment is a collaborative one, then it doesn’t make sense to try to put your head down and push through it, as your work performance will suffer alongside your mental health. Before leaving, try to end the working relationship on good terms with at least one person to make sure you can get a reference for the future. And when interviewing for a new position, do not hesitate to ask about what conflict resolution looks like at the new company and if they have problems with cancel culture at work. Need the motivation to sort out your day? Start using time management software! Cancel culture in the workplace is a bad sign. Unless it’s addressed quickly and effectively, it risks spiraling out of control, hurting not just the victim, but the company’s bottom-line, too. They’ll get a bad rep, especially if the disgruntled employee decides to go public with what has happened to them. But, if you’re the victim, don’t take it lightly. Being socially ostracized can have long-lasting negative effects, doubly so if you believe you’re completely innocent. Don’t hesitate to reach out to some mental health professionals or seek out support groups for victims of canceling.

https://www.workthegreymatter.com/cancel-culture-how-it-works-four-useful-examples/,06-July-2020,"Cancel culture: how it works, what it does, plus four useful examples to have at your fingertips","Studies on hope, sex and Scripture Studies on hope, sex and Scripture I’ve seen a number of stories recently about individuals and organisations standing up for what they believe is right. Some left me with fuzzy warm feelings. Others not so much. In their midst is much talk of “cancel culture,” though most uses have negative connotations of “intolerance”, “outrage culture” and “mob mentality.” And it makes me ask: when does cancel culture become bullying? Because withdrawing support for public figures isn’t always a bad thing. To wrap our heads around this, I think there are a few things we need to appreciate. First, cancel culture is a way for one culture to act against another culture. It is inherently about differences of values and priorities. And this isn’t always bad. Some cultures are incredibly toxic and need to be resisted and overcome. For example, rape culture. Second, cancel culture is linked to our societal concepts of shame. And I want to be clear about what I do and don’t mean by shame. People often say that shame is the feeling you have when you think there’s something wrong with you. OK, but that’s not how I define it. In my book, shame is the feeling of fear you have when you believe you deserve to be excluded from the community. Shame is about being cast out. It’s about non-belonging. Now, bear with me, because I know shame is often inflicted as an abuse tactic. And my goodness, shaming is a very powerful abuse tactic. But. Abuse is also about the telling of a lie. Regardless of whether we intend or want to inflict the fear inherent within shame itself (and for the record, the Holy Spirit never does this), we can still believe, and most of us do, that some things should not belong in our communities. And this principle of non-belonging is why cancel culture is linked to (but not the same as) how our society and communities understand shame. OK, now for number three: when counter-culture focusses on non-belonging, it has two main tools: expulsion and boycotting. You’ll notice I’ve dropped the term “cancel culture” already and that’s because it gets used in different ways by different people. Merriam Webster defines it as “removing support of public figures on the basis of their objectionable opinions or actions.” That’s boycotting. Recently though, Jonathan Merritt applied the term more broadly. Writing about the Southern Baptist Convention, he described evangelical “cancel culture” as something that forced out members (and not just leaders) from within the denomination. I’ll pick up on what he said in more detail in my next post, but the point for now is this: what he described is expulsion. And whatever definition of “cancel culture” you use, it’s more important to recognise these two related-but-distinct tactics: expulsion and boycotting. OK, point four: expulsion and boycotting have two core purposes: community curation and reputation management. And five: community curation and reputation management can be internally directed or externally directed – or indeed both. We need to take these last two points together because only when we evaluate the purpose and direction of an action can we get a feel for whether we’re seeing ethics in action, or age-old bullying. OK, let’s walk through four examples to illustrate the above. This is expulsion working as internal community curation as Twitter’s statement about keeping Twitter safe makes pretty clear. Now we can debate whether Twitter is ever a ‘safe’ place, and we can debate whether more needs to be done, but that is not the point here. The point is, they’re internally curating their platform, using expulsion, in order to make their space a healthier, happier place for its members. This action is also external reputation management. Sure, Twitter did this partly to send a message to its users, but it strikes me that the bigger message is to the world at large, and advertisers, about where Twitter’s ethics and priorities lie. This is essentially a type of boycott directed at the Harry Potter author JK Rowling, and he did it in response her anti-trans writing. However, despite it being a boycott his action isn’t externally targeted: he’s not trying to change JK Rowling’s attitudes or even tell his viewers to take a particular action. Rather, this is internal curation of his YouTube space as someone who supports trans rights. He’s recognising his responsibilities as a reviewer of film adaptations of books and as he said on Twitter: “There’s a big difference between choosing to stay a part of a fandom and trying to profit off it like I was.” [Edited to add: He’s since decided to go beyond this (video here) and Lindsay Ellis did a video looking at the question of staying part of a fandom.] This boycott is an externally directed attempt at community curation. Verizon isn’t trying to change itself, but rather to influence Facebook to change its behaviours. Specifically, Verizon wants Facebook to do better advert placement because at the moment Verizon ads are appearing next to hate speech. And when you look at it from that angle, I wouldn’t be surprised if Verizon’s decision is mostly driven by concern for their external reputation as an advertiser. Meanwhile, the advocacy organisations behind the “Stop Hate For Profit” campaign (which prompted Verizon’s action) have broader aims. They’re urging all advertisers to suspend their Facebook advertising for the month of July. They’re necessarily different from Verizon because they’re not doing this to preserve their external reputation. Rather, they’re doing it because they believe that Facebook doesn’t do enough to internally curate its platform. They are trying to curate a space external to their own because they believe that is the right thing to do. Let’s pause for a moment. The Stop Hate For Profit campaign is urging people outside of its space to take action; Dominic Noble however isn’t asking people to exit the Harry Potter fandom. This is an important distinction. For one thing, it shows the Stop Hate For Profit campaign is more about external curation, whilst Dominic Noble’s actions are principally internal curation. For another, it shows something about what they believe they have the right to ask the general public for. The advocacy groups believe they have the right to ask individuals and organisations to not give money to a platform that they believe has unsafe curation. Meanwhile, Dominic Noble doesn’t believe he has the right to ask his fans to not like Harry Potter. Lastly, although Dominic Noble and the Stop Hate For Profit campaign are both using boycotts, neither is trying to stop the boycotted party from existing. In particular, Stop Hate For Profit isn’t trying to stop Facebook from operating, but to get Facebook to operate better. These considerations are all going to be relevant in the next post when we consider when cancel culture becomes bullying. OK, on to the last example for now, and it’s slightly older with less familiar names, but what it illustrates is important. For a professional services firm, reputation is huge, because if your people can’t be trusted, you have no business. KPMG’s audit work gets inspected by a regulator and, basically, when these partners received a tip about what particular audit work would be scrutinised, they exploited it. The firm’s response, once the wider leadership found out, is clearly an example of expulsion. But in contrast to the Twitter example above, the focus is less about internal curation, and more about external reputation management — albeit, as with Twitter, both are applicable. We need to remember that these partners knew that what they were doing was wrong. Their ethics breach was so flagrant, KPMG’s reputation would suffer unsustainable damage if these partners didn’t go. I say this example is important, because it illustrates how expulsion for the sake of an organisation’s external reputation can be an ethical action. Unfortunately, there are so many examples where expulsion is used abusively, and to shame people who were set up to fail, it can be easy to think that exclusion is always about scapegoating and pitchfork mentality. No, it’s not. It can be and it is far more often than it should be, but it’s not always. And this is why we need to be discerning about what separates ethical and transformational counter culture, from toxic bullying and harassment. That will be the subject of my next post.

Sia, canceled. Dr. Suess, canceled. J.K. Rowling, canceled.The list goes on and on. Cancel culture: the term used to describe the popular practice of withdrawing support for public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered offensive. While you may think cancel culture is a new concept, Dr. Jill McCorkel begs to differ. She tells the New York Post, “Societies have punished people for behaving outside of perceived social norms for centuries…and this (cancel culture) is just another variation.” Gen Z has reinvented what it means to be canceled with the new use of cancel culture through social media. With the help of social media, canceling someone has become much easier as someone new is getting canceled everyday, like celebrities, brands, television shows and movies, or even kids at school. While some argue that social media had little influence on cancel culture, I believe social media remains the leading factor for why cancel culture is so influential in today’s society. Social media has had a big impact on cancel culture as it has allowed people to be held accountable for their actions. The Rolling Stones performed at the Altamont Music Festival in 1969, an event that was supposed to be fun, but ended up forever changing the lives of the victims and their families. Four innocent people died during the performance. One victim, Meredith Hunter, was stabbed just 20 feet from the stage. Many others were injured and a number of cars were stolen and abandoned. The Rolling Stones continued and finished their performance despite what was happening in the crowd. Many think the motorcycle club Hells Angels are to blame for the chaos. They are an outlaw motorcycle gang associated with drug dealing, trafficking stolen goods, and prositution. This event was featured in the Rolling Stones documentary Gimme Shelter but none of the Stones have ever publicly spoken about it. The Rolling Stones have been able to continue their career and are going on their 60 years tour in the US very soon. Over fifty years later and this event has received barely any media coverage, especially compared to a similar event that occurred on November 5th, 2021 at the Astroworld Festival during Travis Scott’s performance. What occurred during this festival was a crowd surge that left many injured and 10 dead. The youngest victim at astroworld was nine year old Ezra Blount. Along with him, ages of victims also include 14, 16, 21, 22, and 27. More than 300 people were injured and hospitalized, many going into cardiac arrest. This ended in tragedy due to the poorly organized event. There was an anticipated crowd of 70,000 but only 70 medics were employed and security was not checking tickets at the entry so people were able to sneak in. Scott claimed to not have realized what was going on even though many people were shouting and trying to get his attention as well as security’s attention. He has since kept out of the public eye, for example, he was removed from headlining the Coachella 2022 festival, the Travis Scott Fortnite skin was deleted from the game, and even his presence on social media has been minimal. Very similar events happened to The Stones and Scott, yet why did one face bigger repercussions than the other? Immediately following the concert, #canceltravisscott started trending on every social media platform thinkable: Twitter, Tik Tok, Instagram and Snapchat. It is evident that one main thing remains responsible for the significant differences in the treatments of these two artists: social media. On the other hand, there are many examples in history where social media has no relevance to the “cancellation” of someone. In 1995, during Bill Clinton’s presidency, he had an affair with his intern, Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was impeached because of this affair. Rather than the public equally blaming Clinton and Lewinsky for what had happened, the public and the media rather decided to blame only Lewinsky. People only associate and still associate her name with a sex scandal. Clinton’s name is associated with the President of the United States, an honorary title.The media called Lewinsky a slut, homewrecker, anit-feminist, etc. A Time article titled “The Shaming of Monica: Why We Owe Her an Apology,” states “I was 16, perched with a group of friends in the hallway of my high school, devouring the contents of the Starr report like a trashy romance novel… And yet we did know one thing: we didn’t like that raunchy Lewinsky girl. What kind of woman flashes her thong at the President, anyway?” An ordinary group of teenage girls was even calling Lewinsky a slut, showing the extent the media shamed her. Lewinsky was torn apart in the public eye while Clinton faced half of that. She was only 22, while he was 48; he was the president while she was just an intern. There was a power dynamic that made Clinton the more powerful one yet he was still not blamed for what had happened. While Clinton did face repercussions, he was able to come back while Lewinsky was not and still faces repercussions. However, since he was the president it should have been the opposite. Bill Clinton was able to abuse his power and got Lewinsky ‘canceled.’ It seemed as though everyone in America was against her, she was made a fool of. All this happened without the help of social media. Now, social media has definitely been able to shed light on the event in present times but at the time of the scandal, social media did not even exist. Society as whole collectively decided to hate Lewinsky, which in modern terms would be known as “cancel culture.” While this example may seem to add to the argument that social media had no influence on this particular event, it is also easily arguable that mass media was the social media of this time. Both are able to spread information quickly to the public. It was Clinton’s power that swayed the media to side with him, a tactic used by people with larger platforms on social media today. Mass media and social media have the same amount of power, and both could end one’s career in a matter of seconds. All it took was one article expressing shame on Lewinsky and everyone followed. Everywhere you look, someone new is getting canceled. Cancel culture has now even extended to ordinary kids getting canceled, not just people in the public eye. It has come to the point that people are abusing what it means to be canceled, a harmful influence created by social media. Rather than canceling those for commiting crimes, people now rather choose to cancel those for much smaller actions. I don’t beleive there is a way to change social media’s effect on cancel culture as cancel culture is too normalized in today’s society. One of the main uses of social media is to share your opinions. If we did not allow people to do this, a large majority of users would stop using social media altogether. The only way to really change the impact would be to ‘cancel’ social media. How has Social Media Affected Cancel Culture?

The phenomenon of cancel culture, in other words, the popular practice of group defamation, where people primarily on social networks express their disapproval of the actions of individuals or companies, massively criticize them and put social pressure on them to correct their behavior, publicly apologize or completely stop supporting the ""perpetrators"", has been making a stir on social networks for a good ten years now, and it is not treating anybody with kid gloves. If you think that cancel culture only affects the world of chronically online people, you are terriblz wrong. Over the past decade (the start of the term cancel culture is attributed to 2015), many celebrities or companies have lost not only reputation, business, collaborations but also relationships. Social media has thus become a place of modern public judgment. In the digital age, social networks are no longer just a place for sharing content and creating communities, but also a kind of people's courtroom. The wave of criticism can be so strong that it can destroy a career, image or business built up over several years in a matter of days. On the other hand, it also has the power to catapult someone into the spotlight. How does this 'internet tribunal' work and who gets into the dock? The phenomenon of public sentencing is not new; you are familiar with blacklists. The difference today is that individuals can express their opinion publicly and immediately, many times, unfortunately, without any verification of the information. Public opinion is formed extremely quickly on social networks. Evidence against the 'accused'? Screenshots of conversations, acts caught on video, old social media posts. Many times, it takes very little and the fate of the person in question is sealed. The battle to protect reputations begins, public opinion changes within days or even hours. What follows can have long-lasting consequences, not just a sudden lost of followers. In the past, when social media did not exist, the traditional media was the main source of information. Public opinion was slower to form, and allegations or cases reached the public through investigative reporting or tabloids. Celebrities and companies had time to react, issue statements and sometimes manage a reputational crisis without fatal consequences. And many cases were simply swept under the rug. Social media has allowed 'cancellation' of public figures to become a mass phenomenon, with the public often replacing the traditional media in deciding who 'deserves' to be the victim of hate and shame. Well-known personalities or companies can come under fire from critics unexpectedly and extremely quickly, but they also have the chance to immediately defend themselves and express their opinion before the total avalanche of hate is unleashed. Rather than waiting for press releases or making statements through PR agencies, they can manage the communication themselves and thus have more control over the narrative. However, here you're walking on a very thin ice, it only takes one insincere statement for the whole situation to escalate - case in point is influencer and Youtuber James Charles, whose public apology in 2019 was deemed insufficient by a modern social media court, triggering an avalanche of hate as well as the whole 'revocation' process. What's actually on the side of defense? Mainly the die-hard fans who don't believe the accusations and come to your rescue. But that won't be enough for the modern public court - transparency and quick reaction, not shirking responsibility, actively addressing the issue or not underestimating the PR crisis are key. Ultimately, it comes down to accepting responsibility, publicly apology and seeking redress. No one can hide what has come to light anymore, but you can still minimize the damage. The internet will forgive you. But it won't forget. Not everything is black and white when it comes to cancel culture. Although the term carries negative connotations, it often helps to expose cases of, for example, sexual harassment, discrimination or abuse of power. It has the ability to give a voice to victims who would not otherwise speak out, and public pressure is forcing companies and celebrities alike to be more accountable. In many cases, it brings justice and highlights systemic problems that would otherwise go unnoticed. Let's face it, the more power and fame people have, the more they tend to act privileged and out-of-touch, as they are almost 'untouchable'. The problem is that it can very quickly slide into inappropriate vilification, when often family members of the 'accused' are attacked. Cancel culture is essentially a form of cyberbullying. While it has the power to expose real problems, force individuals or companies to take responsibility, and has led to significant movements such as #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter, we must also look at its long-term impact. Some experts agree that it turns complex social problems into black-and-white trials, where social networks are judge, jury and executioner at the same time, and focuses on individuals instead of solving systemic problems, i.e. 'abolishing' them. As long as we don't get blinded by the huge wave of hate, we may one day be able to turn cancel culture into a righteous tool for exposing toxic or even illegal behavior and promoting social change. But what are the rules of this new digital law? Can due process be ensured at all? These remain open questions to which there is no clear answer yet.

To avoid falling victim to cancel culture, should you avoid being online or are there ways to inoculate your reputation? Here, we'll look at three proven systems to manage your reputation online. Sixty years ago, people would cancel their subscriptions to magazines if a particular article or advertisement offended them. Today, participating in ""cancel culture"" might mean ending a personal relationship, getting someone fired or generating a firestorm of negativity online. A single tweet can end a careerâor unleash over 1 million retweets in a single day. People are getting canceled when they slip up, resulting in social media outrage, boycotting and great risk to their reputation. It's not just celebrities who are in danger here; anyone with an online presence can be canceled. Since your actions online reflect on you (and most likely your company, too), it's up to you to manage your reputation so you don't get dragged through the mud.Â I've counseled many individuals who are worried about that outcome. Let's start by identifying when are we most at risk of cancel culture. Sometimes, everyday people get in hot water when they act out of line with their values. Even more often, a public comment deemed offensive or inappropriate upsets an audience whose values and beliefs you didn't understand fully or were careless in addressing.Â It's natural to be daunted by the prospect of cancel culture. The risks to your career and business are high. Here's my top advice on how to proactively build and manage a cancel-proof reputation online. I've heard people say that you should hide or stay silent if you don't want to get canceled. In fact, the opposite is true. The more visibility you give your values, beliefs and work online, the harder it would be for your words and actions to be taken out of context.Â Your digital capital is valuable; it grants you power. When you stay silent or post without clear intent, you give away that power. Internet ""trolls"" love to misinterpret the words and actions of others. The less context you have, the easier it is for trolls to swoop in. In order to build a strong context for the things you post, make sure you are intentional and clear in everything you put out there. Clarify and emphasize your values and stick to content that supports those values. Unless it's aligned with your personal brand and reputation goals, resist engagingÂ with negativity and highly charged topics online. As you build your personal brand, strategically use your voice and be intentional with the content you share online. Make sure it aligns with your values and who you are as a person. That way, you'll make the most of your online visibility. Pay close attention to the company you keep. Cancel culture doesn't just target those who actively make a mistake online; other people in their personal and professional networks can be dragged down with them by association.Â Curate your immediate network to ensure that their values align with yours. Your contacts don't necessarily have to share your exact passions and mission, but their beliefs should align in theme with yours. For example, if your religion plays a large part in your life, build a network of people to whom their faith is also important. In a broader sense, your network should reflect the values you espouse. For instance, if you post about how important diversity is to you, your network should be composed of diverse individuals. Make sure you're practicing what you preach, especially with your relationships. When you don't know what makes your online audience tick, you're in grave danger of posting something tone-deaf, inappropriate or offensive. Consider the example of celebrities who faced backlash for complaining for having to quarantine in gorgeous mansions at the beginning of the pandemic. Their comments were criticized for being tone deaf to those living with far worse situations in lockdown. This kind of problem can arise easily when people get too comfortable in a casual conversation online or start to feel anonymous behind a keyboard. Know who your communities are online. Educate yourself on who is reading and spreading your content, and who you would like to target with your message.Â Check the demographic analytics that Google, Facebook, and other tech hubs provide for you. Research what has gotten others in your field into tough spots. Remember that you're in control of your online presence. Building context, curating your network and understanding your audience will go a long way towards inoculating your personal brand and reputation against cancel culture. Trolls will always be a part of the internet,Â but as long as you use these resources to take a confident, constructive and positive approach to your content, people in your circle will be inspired to respond in kind.Â **As previously appeared on Entrepreneur.com If you want to learn more about building, repairing, and managing your reputation, check out these great resources: DNR-Discipline's No Reason.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., goes back to her office after speaking on the floor of the House Chamber on Capitol Hill on Feb. 4. Andrew Harnik/AP hide caption Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., goes back to her office after speaking on the floor of the House Chamber on Capitol Hill on Feb. 4. ""Cancel culture"" is everywhere. No, not cancel culture the phenomenon (that is, if you believe it is a phenomenon, an opinion that is itself contentious). Rather, ""cancel culture"" is everywhere — as in, the phrase that inundates you lately when you listen to a political speech or turn on cable news. The phrase is so pervasive that it's arguably background noise in American politics now — just part of the wallpaper, a pair of words you might easily (or, depending on your feelings, happily) breeze past every day without paying it any attention. Republicans have for a long time used the phrase ""cancel culture"" to criticize the left. But lately, they have seized on it particularly aggressively. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan used it to defend his fellow Republican, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, as she was stripped of her House committee assignments following her support of conspiracy theories including QAnon, as well as racist social media posts.​ ""Everyone has said things they wish they didn't say. Everyone has done things they wish they didn't do,"" Jordan said. ""So who's next? Who will the cancel culture attack next?"" The cancel culture attacks have also happened within the party, and have been aimed by moderates toward more conservative Republicans. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger slammed Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz recently for the Donald Trump loyalist's attacks on House GOP conference chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who voted to impeach the former president.​ ""If you look at Matt Gaetz going to Wyoming, because — what — a tough woman has an independent view and he doesn't want to go out and explain why he didn't vote for impeachment?"" Kinzinger told NBC's Chuck Todd. ""That's totally GOP cancel culture!"" Greene and Cheney, of course, still have congressional seats and sizable social media followings, and they appear regularly on national television. All of which raises the question of what exactly it means to be ""canceled."" In about half a decade, the phrase has gone from its slang origins to being laden with partisan political baggage. And the recent GOP fixation on cancel culture is, for some, a sign of a party that has strayed from its core tenets. Where did ""cancel"" come from? Six or seven years ago, the idea of ""canceling"" someone was largely used among younger people online, particularly on Black Twitter, as Vox's Aja Romano has explained. In that usage, ""cancel"" refers to a pretty unremarkable concept, says Nicole Holliday, assistant professor of linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania. ""It is used to refer to a cultural boycott,"" she said. ""We've had the term 'boycott' forever and ever. It just means, 'I'm not going to put my attention or money or support behind this person or organization because they've done something that I don't agree with.' That is not new, that's very old."" In other words, it was just the marketplace of ideas at work. But as the concept gained popularity, concerns grew, particularly among media and political elites, about the threat of online mobs shutting down speech. That perceived punitive atmosphere came to be known as ""cancel culture,"" and people on the left were often accused of perpetuating it. ""If people say, 'Hey, I personally don't like this person, so I'm not going to buy the products,' that's one thing,"" said Yascha Mounk, a political scientist and creator of the newsletter Persuasion, which has decried so-called ""cancel culture."" ""But a lot of it is concerted efforts to force institutions to de-platform people,"" he said. ""It's firing people for imagined or very minor offenses because of sort of online media mobs and so on."" Mounk is especially concerned about the fact that even nonpublic figures have lost jobs as a result of online pile-ons, as he detailed in The Atlantic. To him, that is a clear sign things have gone too far. The idea of a ""cancel culture"" is inherently controversial. What one person might see as being canceled for controversial statements, another might see as being held accountable for offensive or harmful views. But now, even to some who decry ""cancel culture"" as a problem, the phrase has been overstretched to defend people like Marjorie Taylor Greene who have expressed offensive and violent views. Mona Charen is policy editor at the right-leaning magazine The Bulwark, and worries people ""canceling"" each other stifles free expression. She wrote, for example, in defense of former New York Times writer Bari Weiss, after Weiss became the focus of the ""cancel culture"" debate when she resigned from the paper after outcry over some of her writings and online statements. While Charen still worries about that, she also feels the phrase ""cancel culture"" has outgrown its usefulness. ""Honestly, I think we should probably retire the phrase 'cancel culture' at this point, because it's losing its meaning when people just use it to mean, 'I resent your drawing attention to my crazy ideas,' "" she said. Cancel culture and the GOP's future With the constant repetition of the phrase ""cancel culture,"" the idea of ""cancellation"" has strayed from what it once stood for. Simultaneously, the GOP's cancel culture fixation may be seen as a sign that the party is straying from what it once stood for, and instead fixating on nonsubstantive debates. ""There truly were 15 years ago differences of policy for which people would say, 'Hey,' for instance, 'Arlen Specter, at what point are you still a Republican? Because you believe a lot of things that are counter to what many conservatives and many people who animate the party believe,' "" said conservative author and CNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham. Specter was a moderate Republican senator who eventually became a Democrat. In contrast, Ham points to the Arizona GOP's recent decision to censure several of its most visible members, including conservative Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. ""​Now, the condemnations in Arizona are for Doug Ducey and others not being sufficiently helpful to President Trump and those who support him,"" she said. In Ham's opinion, yes, liberals have a cancel culture problem (and some liberals would counter that cancel culture doesn't exist). But with GOP members censuring one another, Ham believes the right now has a cancel culture problem, too. And furthermore, it translates to a numbers problem, if attacking one another means pushing away voters in a swing state like, say, Arizona. Ham says it's not clear how this tone might ever change from a fixation on a ""cancel culture"" war back to tenets like limited government and lower taxes.​ ""Would I love to get back to talking about policy? Sure, but there is to some extent a need to recognize that that might not be what your voters want,"" she said. ""The way that social media is structured, you get a payout for high emotion, for clickability. And your 40-point tax plan is not emotional or clickable."" The right shows no sign of letting go of attacking ""cancel culture"" on the left, either. It was even invoked by former Trump's lawyer in the impeachment trial on Tuesday. And when the annual Conservative Political Action Conference is held later this month, it will be with theme: ""America Uncanceled."" Linguistic evolution and devolution Language gets stretched like this all the time, Nicole Holliday of the University of Pennsylvania says. In fact, there's a term for it: ""semantic bleaching.""​ ""Semantic bleaching kind of refers to the process where words don't have the meaning they had before,"" she said. ""They kind of come to mean nothing or something that is purely pragmatic, like just functional, but not really like laden with meaning."" ""Semantic bleaching"" has happened for nonpolitical words, like ""literally,"" and more political phrases, like ""politically correct"" and ""woke"" (a word NPR's Sam Sanders eulogized in 2018). As with the word ""cancel,"" both of those terms went from their original meaning to being political weapons used by people claiming concerns about free expression. Political correctness, for example, was an in-joke among liberals before it was a political cudgel. ""In the '70s and '80s, it was originally used by leftists kind of to make fun of themselves,"" Holliday explains. ""By the time it entered the mainstream in the '90s, everybody was using it as sort of an attack. It wasn't any longer in the community that it originated in. And then I think we're seeing the same thing kind of with 'cancel.'"" ""Cancel,"" ""woke"" and ""political correctness"" all also happen to be phrases that can be (and have been) used to sincerely debate the best way for a society to be inclusive. But that also is perhaps what made them so easily weaponizable: those original usages imply that there are ideas or words that are not inclusive — that for discourse be inclusive, some speech has to be excluded. And that idea is bound to get some people very angry in a country that deeply prizes free speech but does not agree on what ""free speech"" means.

https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescoachescouncil/2020/03/25/one-way-forward-from-a-cancel-culture-to-an-accountable-culture/,25-March-2020,One Way Forward: From A Cancel Culture To An Accountable Culture,"ByThom Pulliam ByThom Pulliam, Former Forbes Councils Member. Photo: I got canceled. It happened just three weeks into a role a recruiter placed me in leading social media strategy for a top global tech brand. What happened? In a blink, a client whom I never saw face to face filed a quick complaint. Without fact-checking, conferring with colleagues or seeking a better resolution, my employer sent me packing. Dumbstruck, but not oblivious to the pervasiveness of this phenomenon, I took pause to question the state of teams at work. Cancel culture defies the oneness of our shared experience and seeks to separate and radicalize us. It’s about control rather than flow. Denying versus accepting. Destroying versus building. Cancel culture is ignorant of the win-win mentality that uplifts everyone, and it will continue to run rampant until it’s exposed and released. Cancel culture begins when a person uses their voice to pass judgment on another — often, I think, while operating with limited and even distorted information. It runs amuck in digital communications as our endorphins rush in reaction to whatever makes us feel injured or insecure. Cancel culture shows up as the sometimes-flippant response of firing or boycotting someone or something while influencing others to do the same. I see it as a form of bullying that is an outright rejection of the other. It can aim to build a mob mentality to drown out and shun others in the naïve belief that aggressive protectionism is the correct response in a world that grows smaller by the second. Recently, social media star Rickey Thompson put the modern experience this way: ""A lot of people make mistakes. We have to learn from our mistakes, but you don't have to learn in a way where people are just being rude to you, and bashing you, saying stuff like you should die. [...] So I hate cancel culture."" The backlash created by the friction of cancel culture is bad business. It damages everyone's reputation, esteem and goodwill. People impacted by cancel culture can lose deals and are no longer surprised to be drowned in a peer-review tsunami or clapped back on by trolls. In an age of instant connection, brash words can be dangerous. Former president Barack Obama warned that accelerated by social media, there is this sense sometimes ""that the way of making change is to be as judgemental as possible about other people. If I tweet or hashtag about how you didn't do something right or used the wrong verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself because 'Man did you see how woke I was? I called you out!'"" Kindness is the antidote. We all want to win at work and in life. But success requires much more than an individual's sheer passion, which runs out of oxygen on its own. Real, or what you might call holistic, success has longevity and is mindful of not destroying the ecology of which it is a part. It acknowledges interdependence and requires compassion, which has space for everyone and so much self-replenishing fuel that it can never be snuffed out. As talent operating within and setting the vision for the future of work, we get to choose how our relationships go from here. Do we adopt a set of attitudes and behaviors that support the health of ourselves, those with whom we do business and our agile, decentralized working environment? Or are we complacent with or, worse yet, compliant to today's cancel culture? Do we wish to work in freedom or fear? The choice is usually that easy. Let’s build each other up, not tear each other down. Let’s work in the light, not the shadows. Advocating for open dialogue and debate will mindfully create a culture of work that’s safe for all to thrive — one that celebrates respect, collaboration, improvement and learning cycles, pride in ownership, focus on delivering value and the ability to adapt to change. Life exists in our conversations, and our power as social creatures is available only while in relationship with one another. So let's own it. All of it. Especially the breakdowns. Let's take 100% responsibility for everything, as if our lives and jobs depend on it — because they do. It’s on us how we choose to engage. It’s time to refresh ourselves and our relationships with the blessing of not jumping to conclusions. For an accountable culture to take hold in place of a cancel culture, it’s essential to believe that everyone is doing their best and to acknowledge where we’re at. With positive psychology as our guide, we can stop having as many problems with people and channel our energy into that which we aspire to create. In today’s world, if you don’t get along with others having some spectrum of difference from you, then you won’t succeed and grow. If you arbitrarily cast judgment on what is right and wrong from just your viewpoint alone, you cut off the value available to be received from willful diversity and inclusion. If you can’t deal with the differences between you and other people, it’s not just others who have a problem. It’s you. Here are a few illuminating inquiries toward a culture of accountability: • What assumptions, excuses or deflections do I make that jeopardize positive outcomes? • Do I have confidence in my intuition and heed and communicate red flags? • How does any lack of trust manifest? Is it due to the actions of others, outside circumstances or my insecurities? • Do I communicate honestly about critical issues? Am I forthcoming and supportable? • Do I support others to be forthright with me without fear of punishment? • Are all parties clear on what’s at stake at all times? • Do I examine the full story before speaking out? • Can I accept this situation for myself? For another? • If I feel overwhelmed, do I take time to process before responding? • Have I given myself and others the freedom to not be right?",bythom pulliam bythom pulliam forb council photo cancel happen week role recruit lead social medium strategi top global tech brand happen blink client file quick complaint check confer colleagu seek resolut employ pack dumbstruck oblivi pervas phenomenon paus question team cancel cultur defi on share tongu stick erienc seek separ radic control flow deni versu accept destroi versu build cancel cultur ignor win win mental uplift continu run rampant tongu stick os releas cancel cultur begin person voic pass judgment oper limit distort inform run amuck digit commun endorphin rush reaction make feel injur insecur cancel cultur flippant respons fire boycott influenc form bulli outright reject aim build mob mental drown shun belief aggress protection correct respons world grow recent social medium star rickei thompson modern tongu stick erienc lot peopl mistak learn mistak learn peopl rude bash stuff die hate cancel cultur backlash creat friction cancel cultur bad busi damag reput esteem goodwil peopl impact cancel cultur lose deal surpris drown peer review tsunami clap troll ag instant connect brash word danger presid barack obama warn acceler social medium sens chang judgement peopl tweet hashtag wrong verb sit feel pretti wake call kind antidot win life success requir individu sheer passion run oxygen real call holist success longev mind destroi ecologi acknowledg interdepend requir compass space replenish fuel snuff talent oper set vision futur choos relationship adopt set attitud behavior support health busi agil decentr environ complac bad compliant cancel cultur freedom fear choic easi build tear light shadow advoc dialogu debat mindfulli creat cultur safe thrive celebr respect collabor improv learn cycl pride ownership focu deliv abil adapt chang life exist convers power social creatur relationship breakdown respons life job depend choos engag time refresh relationship bless jump conclus account cultur hold cancel cultur essenti acknowledg posit psychologi guid stop peopl channel energi aspir creat world don spectrum differ win succe grow arbitrarili cast judgment wrong viewpoint cut receiv will divers inclus deal differ peopl illumin inquiri cultur account assumpt excus deflect jeopard posit outcom confid intuit heed commun red flag lack trust manifest due action circumst insecur commun honestli critic issu forthcom support support forthright fear punish parti stake time examin stori speak accept situat feel overwhelm time process respond freedom,24,1,0.26162198846284357,0.19748897183576516,0.15948422124194095,0.06922293858160841,0.07634882931795046,0.1476077366813709,0.08822531387852053,24,Public Ethics & Cancel Culture Ideology
https://time.com/5735403/cancel-culture-is-not-real/,21-November-2019,Cancel Culture Is Not Real—At Least Not in the Way People Think,"“Has cancel culture gone too far?” The question felt impossible to ignore this year. Google it and you’ll see pages of op-eds, often concluding, yes, it has gone too far, and the Internet mob is out of control. Cancel culture became so central to the discourse in 2019 that even President Obama weighed in. The idea is that if you do something that others deem problematic, you automatically lose all your currency. Your voice is silenced. You’re done. Those who condemn cancel culture usually imply that it’s unfair and indiscriminate. The problem with this perspective is cancel culture isn’t real, at least not in the way people believe it is. Instead, it’s turned into a catch-all for when people in power face consequences for their actions or receive any type of criticism, something that they’re not used to. I’m a black, Muslim woman, and because of social media, marginalized people like myself can express ourselves in a way that was not possible before. That means racist, sexist, and bigoted behavior or remarks don’t fly like they used to. This applies to not only wealthy people or industry leaders but anyone whose privilege has historically shielded them from public scrutiny. Because they can’t handle this cultural shift, they rely on phrases like “cancel culture” to delegitimize the criticism. Since the #MeToo hashtag went viral in 2017, more women have spoken out about their experiences with sexual harassment and assault. While many people have applauded this movement, some men now say they fear even casual interactions with women will get them canceled. Only that’s not what’s happening. While some powerful men may not have the status they once did, they have hardly been canceled. Louis CK admitted to masturbating in front of female comedians. He was dropped by his agency, and HBO and Netflix cut ties with him, but he recently sold out five shows in my home city of Toronto. Harvey Weinstein—who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 80 women (he has denied the allegations) and charged with predatory sexual assault, a criminal sexual act and rape (he has pleaded not guilty)—lost his job, but when he showed up at a young artists’ event in October, a comedian who called him out in her set was booed and two women who confronted him were asked to leave. When political journalist Mark Halperin, who denied allegations of unwanted sexual contact but acknowledged that his “behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain,” faced pushback over a new book, his publisher spoke to the New York Post decrying “this guilty-until-proven-innocent cancel culture where everyone is condemned to death or to a lifetime of unemployment based on an accusation that’s 12 years old.” That criticism is being compared to death tells you a lot about some of the people arguing that cancel culture has run amok. In September, comedian Shane Gillis was fired from Saturday Night Live after videos of him making racist jokes surfaced. Comedian Bill Burr condemned the firing saying, “You f-cking millennials, you’re a bunch of rats, all of you,” and “None of them care, all they want to do is get people in trouble.” But having a job at SNL isn’t a human right. And although Gillis’ defenders have fretted about the sanctity of free speech in comedy, the audience of a comedic TV show should get to speak out about whether they want to watch someone who has espoused this type of humor. That’s actually the marketplace at work. Why should Gillis be able to utter racist things but those affected by hate speech shut their mouths? Gillis is still a touring comedian. He will be fine. Although use of the term spiked this year, the idea of cancel culture has been bubbling for a while. In 2016, Kim Kardashian shared clips revealing that despite Taylor Swift’s claim that Kanye West didn’t warn her about a provocative lyric, he actually did give her a heads-up and she thanked him. Swift said she was “falsely painted as a liar.” But soon #TaylorSwiftIsCanceled- was trending. “When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being,” Swift told Vogue this summer. “You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, kill yourself.” There aren’t many people who can understand what Swift went through. To have so many people turn on you is surely upsetting. But how exactly was she canceled? Though many people believed that this white woman had disingenuously portrayed herself as a victim of a black bully and made clear that they didn’t find that acceptable, Swift has remained one of the highest-paid celebrities in the world. The conversation reached a new level in October when Obama expressed concern about the way people are called out on social media. “This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,” he said at a summit. He didn’t use the term, but the assumption was he was condemning cancel culture. Now I am certain Obama wasn’t talking about Louis CK in his call for us to be less judgmental. He was pointing out that people are complicated and make mistakes, though I’m not convinced they are being written off in the way he thinks. It should also go without saying that Swift’s perceived offense should not be lumped in with Weinstein’s alleged crimes. But that’s another problem with the conversation about cancel culture. It oversimplifies. The term is used in so many contexts that it’s rendered meaningless and precludes a nuanced discussion of the specific harm done and how those who did it should be held accountable. Rather than panicking that someone might be asked to take a seat, we would all do well to consider the people who are actually sidelined: those who lose professional opportunities because of toxic workplaces, who spend years dealing with trauma caused by others’ actions, who are made to feel unsafe. I write frequently about racism and Islamophobia and have received more death threats, calls for my firing and racist insults than I can keep track of. But when people who believe cancel culture is a problem speak out about its supposed silencing effect, I know they’re not talking about those attacks. When they throw around terms like “cancel culture” to silence me instead of reckoning with the reasons I might find certain actions or jokes dehumanizing, I’m led to one conclusion: they’d prefer I was powerless against my own oppression.

https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/cancel-culture/,31-July-2020,cancel culture,"[ kan-suhl kuhl-cher ] Cancel culture refers to the popular practice of withdrawing support for (canceling) public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive. Cancel culture is generally discussed as being performed on social media in the form of group shaming. When something is canceled, it is nulled, ended, voided. Done, over, no longer wanted, like a TV show or subscription. This sense of cancel is the basic idea behind the slang meaning of canceling a person. When a person is canceled, they are no longer supported publicly. Usually public figures are said to be canceled after it has been discovered that they have done something offensive. It involves calling out the bad behavior, boycotting their work (such as by not watching their movies or listening to their music), and trying to take away their public platform and power. This is often done in a performative way on social media. We should note that a variety of earlier slang senses of cancel can be found reaching into the 1990s. (One such vivid sense is “to murder.”) The spread of this slang sense is commonly credited to Black Twitter in the mid-2010s, which often used cancel about issues of discrimination and racism. Canceling spread as a term and phenomenon in the public consciousness with the #MeToo Movement , as major public figures—from Harvey Weinstein to Matt Lauer to Louis C. K. and R. Kelly—were getting canceled due to credible allegations of sexual violence in their past. Other figures were getting canceled for past racist and anti-LGBTQ remarks, such as Shane Gillis and Kevin Hart, respectively. These figures—and many more—did lose their careers, reputations, or work opportunities after getting canceled. And with respect to #MeToo, many effectively lost their lives as they knew them. But in 2019, there was growing backlash against what came to be called cancel culture in the late 2010s. Culture refers to the shared attitudes and actions of a particular social group. Call-out culture is used in a similar way. Criticisms of cancel culture centered on the feeling that people were becoming too keen to ruin lives over mistakes made many years ago. That people didn’t get a second chance. That social media is too quick to pile on and police increasingly high standards of political correctness and do so in a way that simply is virtue signaling and performatively woke. That canceling has gone too far and simply become a way of rejecting anyone you disagreed with or someone who did something you didn’t like. Former President Barack Obama notably criticized cancel culture (though not using the words as such), arguing that easy social media judgments don’t amount to true social activism. I’m really sick of cancel culture and drama and people having to take a stance or make a statement on absolutely everything all the time. It’s okay to be open minded and sit back a sec to see how things play out before making a solid opinion on something. — 𝖘𝖚𝖟𝖎𝖊☽ (@hello_october_) March 30, 2019 Others, meanwhile, have criticized cancel culture for being ineffective or argue that it isn’t even real—that the likes of Louis C.K. still get a stage and an audience, if less than before, despite the sexual assault claims against him. That people still listen to Michael Jackson’s music despite the sexual and child abuse claims against him. Yet others object to the name cancel culture, arguing that the label misunderstands that people are simply trying to hold people accountable for their actions. Holding someone accountable isn’t the same thing as “cancel culture.” There’s too many people out here who haven’t acknowledged their mistakes, apologized for them, nor have they gone on to make amends; that are using “cancel culture” to shield them from accountability—do better. — Ashlee Marie Preston (@AshleeMPreston) January 25, 2020 Cancel culture started trending again in 2020 amid increased awareness of and opposition to racial injustice following the protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd. Discussion of cancel culture flared up in the mainstream media after the publication of a letter criticizing cancel culture in Harper’s Magazine and President Donald Trump compared cancel culture to totalitarianism. The ongoing protests also led to renewed demands for the canceling of already controversial things such as symbols of the Confederacy, statues of Christopher Columbus, and the name of the Washington Redskins football team, which announced it would change its name after intense pressure from team sponsors. The specific phrase cancel culture typically has a negative connotation. Outside of discussions of the phenomenon as such, the phrase cancel culture is often used to complain that the trend of canceling people has gone too far or is too toxic. We don’t have to call it cancel culture, but we should name the cultural norm of only holding accountable people you never liked, have been waiting to make any mistake, who you couldn’t use, or who you don’t find attractive. — Dana White (@DanaVivianWhite) January 26, 2020 There is also a general process to cancel culture. Evidence of someone, usually a public figure but also businesses, comes out of them saying something offensive, typically involving racism, sexism, or disparagement of other minority groups (LGBTQ people, immigrants, indigenous peoples, people with disabilities). This information spreads online, and social media users call for the person’s cancellation, which comes in various forms of not supporting their work in any way. The calls to cancel someone are then often met with some backlash. Cancel culture can also apply to companies that people object to.

https://davidlat.substack.com/p/the-canceling-of-the-american-mind,01-November-2023,The Canceling Of The American Mind: An Interview With Greg Lukianoff,"When I wrote an op-ed for the Boston Globe titled Big Law’s Cancel Culture, I got an earful from folks who complained about the use of the term “cancel culture” (which was picked by the Globe’s copy editors, not by me). There are many folks who argue the “cancel culture” doesn’t exist or, if it does, it’s greatly exaggerated. While I have concerns about the term “cancel culture”—it carries baggage, causing some people to stop listening—I still do use it. My approach to language is more descriptive than prescriptive, so if a term or phrase is useful, it’s generally okay by me. When you say “cancel culture,” people know what you’re talking about, and I don’t know of an alternative term that refers to exactly the same phenomenon. Cancel-culture denial tends to be more common on the left. I wonder, then, whether some progressives might be more willing to acknowledge it now that some on the left are arguably getting “canceled” for expressing pro-Hamas, pro-Palestine, or anti-Israel views. (Please note my use of the term “arguably”; I’m not here to debate the merits of these controversies, which are very fact-specific, and I condemn anything that crosses the line into threats, harassment, and other speech not protected by the First Amendment.) Indeed, cancellation comes from all sides—a major theme of The Canceling of the American Mind, an excellent new book by Greg Lukianoff, president and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), and Rikki Schlott, a columnist for the New York Post. Lukianoff is left of center and Schlott is right of center, but they agree that cancel culture is real—as they demonstrate in their book, before offering possible responses. If you’re concerned about free speech, cancel culture, and related issues, then you will enjoy my interview of Greg Lukianoff—one of the most eloquent, steadfast defenders of the First Amendment and free-speech values, for more than 20 years. Thanks to Greg for speaking with me, for writing this book, and for defending the freedom of speech and thought in our great nation.

I knowingly anticipated immediate judgment and backlash. In essence, I knew I was going to be canceled. That was the point. I was inviting debate about the entitlement mentality to cancel others at will. What I knew to be true was the lack of legal substance to the argument in favor of cancel culture being used and defended at work. How could there be? For any legitimate social/political argument to arise to future public policy and statutory initiation, there would need to be a foundation based on prior legal precedent. Without legal precedent, cancel culture supporters are just acting arbitrarily based on social passions. Passions and emotions are high certainly. It is not my intention to criticize cancel culture but to show the negative consequences of unfettered and arbitrary bias and the impact legally. Yes, it is still illegal to cancel at work and I invite any argument to support why it is not. I am listening but are you listening to my question here? To ignore me is to cancel me. To accept opposing viewpoints is only wise, as it will convince opponents there may be a sliver of justification for cancel culture. All of our American legal developments that address social concerns always follow this same process seeking a foothold in the rule of law, as discussed below. In response to my first article, I received several angry email responses informing I was wrong about what is cancel culture and accused me of perpetuating whiteness. However, none of the objections to the article provided a legal basis to support the continued use and protection of cancel culture at work. This is my point. Proponents of cancel culture do not even understand the legal issues or just ignore them entirely to perpetuate their narrative. Social movements must have a footing in the rule of law, otherwise, they do not and will not survive. Advocates of cancel culture never cite any legal basis to support its existence but for the fact it just IS and we should all heed it. The future of cancel culture at work will result in lawsuits against individuals based on reverse discrimination. Now, only a select number of federal statutes provide individual liability, particularly 42 USC 1981. Section 1981, as it is commonly referred to, is a post-civil war reconstruction statute to protect and enfranchise early African Americans to own land of their own and to contract for business purposes, both of which did not previously exist. Today, employment lawyers, including myself, use Section 1981 to combat race discrimination in the workplace of any kind, whether Brown, Black, White, Hispanic, Latino, or Asian. Congress and the courts have never specified which race was protected by the statute; actually, the word race was never mentioned in the statutory wording. Although it did set the standard to measure against, as is enjoyed by white citizens. 42 USC Section 1981 states specifically, (a) All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and no other. (b) For purposes of this section, the term make and enforce contracts includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship. (c) The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of State law. Most people who pursue cancel culture at work do not realize they can be sued individually for race discrimination under Section 1981. This is commonly referred to as reverse race discrimination, but that phrase too is also not mentioned in the statutory language. To be clear, reverse race discrimination can apply to any race. Courts are responsible for this development and the use of Section 1981 to protect all races against invidious race discrimination. Cancel culture IS invidious race discrimination. There is no legal argument to be used to say that it is not. The point of this article is to demonstrate the utter lack of foundational legal support behind cancel culture at work. After all, we derive our rights, liberties, and protections from the rule of law. For cancel culture to rise to its assumed zenith, it must first ground itself in the rule of law. What do I mean by this? Let’s assume a cancel culture event occurred at work and the employee perpetrating the canceling seeks to vindicate his legal right, not social right, to cancel another employee. The employee must assert legal standing to do so. Standing is a legal term that defines the right or opportunity to contest a legal interest. Where is the standing to cancel another employee at work? I have yet to hear any cogent argument to support cancel culture standing in the legal, not social, context. There are none. Cancel culture at work is illegal. I predict cancel culture will not survive because it is legally flawed.

https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1848776/hr-achieve-balance-cancel-culture-free-speech,23-November-2023,How can HR achieve a balance between cancel culture and free speech?,"Nada and Andrew Kakabadse consider what can be done when the two collide and threaten controversy in and out of your organisation by Andrew Kakabadse and Nada Kakabadse 23 November 2023 The generally accepted view of cancel culture – the process of actively rejecting, boycotting or ceasing support for specific people or groups because of their socially or morally unacceptable views and actions – is that it came to the fore in around 2017. However, the real origins of this phenomenon date back to 1880 when, as part of a campaign for fair rent and against proposed evictions in County Mayo, Ireland, local activists of the Irish National Land League encouraged retaliation against the land agent: Charles Cunningham Boycott. The result was that neither pubs nor shops would serve Boycott and many of his tenants refused to obey his demands. This is when the term ‘boycott’ came into common usage as a description of isolating and shaming unwelcome individuals or views. Cancel culture can even be said to stretch back as far as Roman times, where there was an effort to cancel out Paganism, or discredit those who directly challenged society’s conventions at the time. Today, cancel culture is represented by a bottom-up, sponsored grievance process, made rapidly public through the latest technology. In this sense it’s nothing new. Challenging each other’s views and applying varied forms of censorship to control the flow of information has been, and still is, a critical part of organised societal life. What has changed is the immediacy and dynamism arising from the role played by the internet and social media platforms. Never before has there been such speed of comment, rebuttal and rebuttal to the rebuttal. In effect, new channels of communication for public interaction have bridged the former divide between private and public spheres. By unlocking the distribution and access of public information, comment, opinion and analysis is now more independent of state control. This place has been overtaken by a private form of censorship, driven by the needs of specific agendas. Social media platforms have also inadvertently allowed governments to become much more in touch with the needs and tempo of society. Today, individuals can rapidly come together, argue their views and pursue particular perspectives, in large part because of these advances in technology. Freedom of expression, with minimal censorship to counter undesired speech, is now what most recognise and interpret as free speech, or promoting a view and allowing its rebuttal. Cancel culture calls out potentially offensive content so that the voice of minorities can be heard and respected – this is the essence of free speech. Today, people can literally voice their opinion in the public domain, as part of a mix of misinformation and radicalism, fuelled by polarised mass media opinion. Advocates hold that cancel culture is an essential tool to fight injustice, while critics condemn the process as an unwarranted interference in public and social discourse and a violation of free speech rights. However, the idea that free speech is about debating who has the right to define what belief or comment is dangerous. What has changed more recently is that the fundamentals of this discussion are argued on social platforms owned by private companies, which are driven by profit and have the power to silence unacceptable views. Cancel culture has encouraged the disapproval of individual acts or statements that have supposedly caused offence. Through social platforms, the ability to summon others to join a cause, or even emergent public affray, is immediate. Depending on the issue, the backlash can be dramatic. Resulting tension is often fuelled by a politically aligned social media class and can serve to enhance an individual’s standing, or damage their social and professional reputation beyond repair. Individuals being boycotted through their work can even face disciplinary or legal action as an outcome and all of this is on the increase. Comment and counter comment are an integral part of democratic conversation, which has forever been exhilarating, threatening and sometimes even intimidating. Today, congregations start virtually, after which crowds gather to publicly share and emphasise their point. Comment, rebuttal and rebuttal of the rebuttal are the three essential components of free speech. Now, as in the past, the rebuttal to the rebuttal is the sensitive and most often problematic area. Former UK home secretary Amber Rudd is a case in point. Invited to speak by the UN Women Oxford Student Society at an event in the lead up to International Women’s Day, Rudd was cancelled 30 minutes before the start of the event. Despite her track record concerning women’s rights, it was ostensibly her role in the Windrush scandal that led to her being singled out. The Oxford Feminist Society said she was “not entitled to be celebrated or upheld as a feminist”. In response, then education secretary Gavin Williamson commented that the government would intervene if free speech was not defended. The rebuttal to the rebuttal was not allowed to proceed because of a weakness in the governance of freedom of speech. Columbia University in the US is one case of a rebuttal to the rebuttal taking place. The address given by the then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia University attracted considerable protest and criticism from the federal government, Senate and others. Despite pressure to cancel the event, the speech was delivered and defended by Columbia as part of its continued drive for pursuing robust debate. Few would doubt that a moral interest in speaking freely contributes to the wellbeing of individuals and the state. Free speech is essential to enhancing democratic participation through divergence of perspective. However, freedom of speech is also discomforting. Being challenged and challenging others results in inevitable tension. But cancel culture is not the real concern. It is whether independent and resilient stewardship is provided by the governing body of the entity involved at the time. What is its reaction at the rebuttal stage? Is the original comment cancelled, or does it proceed? So how should HR and business leaders act? The following points suggest a best practice approach: Remember, cancel culture involves three core elements: speed of comment, rebuttal and rebuttal to the rebuttal. Based on the evidence available, consider: ‘Is the comment (or the person making it) likely to cause discomfort, disrespect or harm?’ If discomfort is already anticipated in advance of raising a truly public interest topic or debate, why cancel? Stand firm and let the dialogue play out. Actual disrespect involves targeted attacks that make deep criticisms of individuals or groups, such as transgender people. They serve no purpose other than to propagate offence or hate. Damage arising from purposefully intrusive comments or actions leading to psychological or physical harm should not be tolerated under any circumstances. Freedom of speech is a right that should be upheld and stands above reputational or risk concerns. Be aware of and understand the law in different natures and cultures. This approach should include various by-laws and religious sensitivities that could cause genuine distress. When a comment or commentor is already in the public domain, the reaction is highly likely to fall into the discomfort category. The challenge continues to be an absence of resilience to withstand the force of a cancel culture rebuttal. Any leadership team needs to adhere to specific compliance requirements, but also stewardship of oversight should be a key concern for leaders. Taking a disciplined and systematic approach to addressing cancel culture challenges is fundamental. The stewardship of cancel culture rebuttal ultimately means reaching a balanced view on the evidence presented. Each case should be considered on its own merits. The most significant question for the governing body is: ‘Is the comment made inducing discomfort, disrespect or harm?’ Cancel culture is of itself a right of freedom of speech and should be treated as such. Discomfort is integral to the democratic freedom of speech.

Polit. Sci., 10 May 2022 Sec. Elections and Representation Volume 4 - 2022 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fpos.2022.805008 This article is part of the Research TopicNegativity, Incivility, and Toxicity in Political DiscussionsView all 6 articles Digital media give the public a voice to discuss or share their thoughts about political and social events. However, these discussions can often include language that contributes to creating toxic or uncivil online environments. Using data from Reddit, we examine the language surrounding three major events in the United States that occurred in 2020 and early 2021 from the comments and posts of 65 communities identified for their focus on extreme content. Our results suggest that social and political events in the U.S. triggered increased hostility in discussions as well as the formation of a set of shared language for describing and articulating information about these major political/social moments. Findings further reveal shifts in language toward more negativity, incivility, and specific language surrounding non-White outgroups. Finally, these shifts in language online were found to be durable and last after the events occurred. Our project identifies that negative language is frequently present on social media and is not necessarily exclusive to one group, topic, or real-world event. We discuss the implications of language as a powerful tool to engage, recruit, and radicalize those within communities online. The year 2020 saw a tremendous amount of political and social changes worldwide as individuals in every country dealt with societal and medical crises resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic (Zoumpourlis et al., 2020). In addition to the global pandemic, the United States contended with nationwide protests against racism (e.g., George Floyd murder protests, Taylor, 2021) and experienced a Presidential election fraught with emotions and hostility (American Psychological Association, 2020). Given these highly salient and pressing issues, it is understandable that in 2020 individuals regularly sought information about these important real-world events. Inevitably, the source where individuals turn to for political and social information matters a great deal, whether that be friends, family, cable news, or online discussions (e.g., Lambert et al., 1988; Althaus and Tewksbury, 2000; Johnson and Kaye, 2013). Diverse sources, both in ideology and platform, have been demonstrated to give citizens broad understanding of politics as well as heightened political tolerance (e.g., Dubois and Blank, 2018). However, there are concerns about the degree to which individuals are exposed to diverse content on social media platforms, in part driven by the structure of the communication platform (Barberá, 2020; Hiaeshutter-Rice et al., 2021). Given the often emotionally charged nature of politics, especially around major events, we might expect that negative, hostile, and uncivil language can be used to describe political/social moments and become part of the standard discourse within like-minded communities (Valentino et al., 2011; Brader and Marcus, 2013). In addition, when major events occur, how online communities respond and the resultant content on platforms can shape the ways in which users view and perceive political and social actions. This has important implications for seeking information, as digital platforms provide a space where political discussions often feature increased toxicity, incivility, negativity, and polarization (Kim et al., 2020). This paper seeks to understand how like-minded communities that are generally focused around intolerance, hate, or extremist views respond to major political and social events. It is particularly focused on how language changes from before and after a political moment in these online spaces. One digital community where this is likely commonplace, and the focus of the present research, is Reddit. Reddit is one of the fastest growing social media platforms and is one of only two online platforms that has experienced statistically significant growth in recent years (Pew Research Center, 2019, 2021).1 While it calls itself the “front page of the Internet,” Reddit has also received extensive attention for the presence of hate and extremist-related content (Massanari, 2020). For example, once-popular subreddits like r/The_Donald and r/MGTOW provided a space for toxic political discussions (Flores-Saviaga et al., 2018; Gaudette et al., 2020).2 Despite Reddit's crackdown on some of the largest problematic communities (Allyn, 2020), less visible, yet still controversial, subreddits continue to operate freely. More notably, these are often a place on Reddit for like-minded individuals to gather to communicate with each other and provide information about current events. This has the potential to create a space for shared language and hostility to develop around recent influential events in the United States (e.g., Presidential elections, social movements, nationwide crises, etc.). The implications of this are important as major social/political moments are a time for individuals to learn about politics, processes, government policy, and given the potentially insular nature of a subreddit, a place for specific narratives to develop around these moments. Although research has begun to explore Reddit as a platform (e.g., Proferes et al., 2021), little research has provided a macro level examination of the specific language engaged with and viewed by its users (e.g., see Nithyanand et al., 2017a,b). Even less research has investigated this in the context of particularly impactful recent social and political events throughout 2020 and early 2021. Through an analysis of 55,797 and 5,087,644 comments across 65 subreddits, the present study seeks to advance this agenda with an exploration into the language used in communities on Reddit identified for their incivility and hostile communication dynamics. In addressing a series of research questions and predictions, the current research examined social media content surrounding three major political/social events that occurred during our time frame: 1) the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests starting on May 25th, 2) 2020 US Presidential Election Day on November 3rd, and 3) the 2021 storming of the US Capitol in an attempted insurrection on January 6th. Our investigation is predicated on the contention that, especially in times of major political moments, self-reinforcing centers of information such as like-minded online communities of equals, have the potential to exacerbate existing group tensions. In addition, how individuals within a group discuss events and moments furthers the development of an uncivil or toxic shared set of language. These are not new arguments (e.g., Kim et al., 2020), but the present research extends the literature in two important ways. First, we conceptually examine how recent/current major events are dealt with in spaces specifically designed to encourage horizontal political discussion and discourse. We propose that major political moments theoretically increase the use of hostile or negative language, and because they are durable, will shape future discourses along these lines in communities that regularly engage in these approaches. Second, from a practical standpoint, we highlight various ways to evaluate content on Reddit using a series of content-analytic tools. By focusing on the nature of language around recent major US political events that occurred in 2020 and early 2021 we offer current and crucial insights into how real-world situations contribute to the use and spread of negative, uncivil, and substantive durable discussions among individuals on Reddit. Individuals turn to social media for many different reasons, including searches for information, escape from negative emotions, and pursuit of positive emotions (Brailovskaia et al., 2020). Most commonly, public opinion data show that the majority of people use online platforms to communicate with others (Pew Research Center, 2011). Individuals typically interact through posting content themselves as well as engaging with content created by others, such as commenting. Indeed, it is important to distinguish between negative interactions and negative content. Toxic or uncivil language in posts and comments is frequent across almost all social media platforms (Leite et al., 2020). Additionally, online incivility is often linked to contextual factors including quotes in an article or the article's topic (Coe et al., 2014). He degree to which online interactions are positive or negative can be further moderated by factors such as the size of an individual's social network (Kim, 2020). While similar concepts, uncivil language can be described as language that is rude or impolite (Merriam-Webster, n.d). Whereas, toxic language is considered to be poisonous or used with the intent to harm others. Kim et al. (2020) argues that definitions of incivility, and the implications or consequences of it online often vary by study. However, despite differing theoretical and methodological criteria, disrespect for others is a common theme in the literature. Existing research describes incivility/toxicity as, “expressing disrespect for someone by using insulting language, profanity, or name-calling; by engaging in personal attacks; and/or by employing racist, sexist, and xenophobic terms” (Kim et al., 2020, p. 924). Interestingly different types of incivility might elicit a range of outcomes from online users. For example, messaging that contains name-calling or vulgarity is often considered particularly uncivil behavior or speech (Kenski et al., 2020). Altogether, uncivil and toxic forms of communication can contribute to a negative information environment. One topic where incivility has experienced a steady increase is in politically focused discussions within the media (Gervais, 2014). Indeed, when users are exposed to uncivil political content that conflicts with their own beliefs this results in more anger and less satisfaction with discourse online (Gervais, 2015). However, it is also critical to consider participants' agreement or disagreement with the toxic information they examine. For example, viewing uncivil information that aligns with an individual's beliefs is likely to increase the incivility of political comments that these individuals use online (Gervais, 2015). People are also typically angered by incivility that specifically targets their ingroup and not angered by like-minded incivility (Gervais, 2017). In other words, we become angered by incivility we disagree with and might choose to engage with incivility that agrees with our beliefs. This means that the connection between negative content and social media is not necessarily one size fits all and might lead some individuals to immerse themselves further into these, often, harmful discussions. In mediated environments this has broad implications as it can socialize individuals to see negativity as a behavior that is generally acceptable online (Hmielowski et al., 2014). This has critical considerations for not only how people interact with each other, but likely how they process information they view in digital spaces. Indeed, the presence of uncivil comments connected to news blogs can increase participants' perceptions that a story is biased (Anderson et al., 2018). Given the frequency of negative comments online this is an important example of how incivility can influence or skew the ways in which individuals understand the content they are exposed to. Further, the relationship between social media and incivility is not inconsequential as toxic language in some situations could be harmful to democratic political discussions (Rossini, 2020). For example, when individuals view uncivil discourse in a digital format it is likely to lead to more issue polarization (Anderson et al., 2014). Altogether, the research above highlights the relationship between uncivil language and digital spaces. Considering the influence that elements of language can have on engagement (e.g., Noguti, 2016) and incivility (Gervais, 2015, 2017) it is important to consider how it affects the ways in which individuals communicate with each other online. One common form of interaction on social media is horizontal communication. This is described as communication among at least two individuals that is participatory and who are at the same level (Costanza-Chock, 2006; Maia et al., 2021). This differs from other forms of communication that might involve information coming from political or media elites to the general public. Given the features of many social media platforms, the Internet is used extensively by individuals to engage in horizontal communication (Castells, 2007). Because horizontal interaction takes place between those who are considered equals it might be especially suitable for digital media websites that encourage communities to form. Indeed, one platform applicable to this, and the discussion of negativity online above, is Reddit. In this context Reddit is an especially relevant website to consider for a few reasons. Mainly, it is important to recognize the forum or norms of the social media platform where the uncivil content is taking place. This might be notable in online communities where conversations are centered on uncivil topics (e.g., racism, sexism, discrimination), user identity is more homogenous along with anonymous, and horizontal forms of communication, even when negative, are encouraged. Launched in 2005, Reddit is currently the 7th most visited website in the United States and 19th in the world (as of February 2021: Alexa Internet, 2021). Data on the demographics of Reddit users identifies that they are mostly male (67%), younger (64% ages 18–29), White (70%), and from the United States (48%) (Pew Research Center, 2016). In addition to its large user base (52 million daily active users) and number of communities (100,000+), this platform is known for its use of topic-oriented communities called subreddits which allow individuals to post content and subsequently provide comments on focused topics (Reddit, n.d.). Additionally, Reddit uses a unique voting system which gives users the ability to upvote or downvote any content that they choose to anonymously. The voting system underlies the algorithm that determines what people see when they view a subreddit, as highly upvoted and commented on posts rise to the top. This is important to the present research for two reasons. First, it causes content that is highly upvoted to move to the top (e.g., becomes more visible) and vice versa for content that is downvoted (e.g., becomes less visible). Second, because voting is anonymous, individuals do not have to be concerned about potential backlash from others for what they upvote or downvote. This aspect of anonymity in evaluating others' content, and creating a profile more generally, is one way that Reddit differs from other social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (Van der Nagel and Frith, 2015). Anonymity on social media platforms can have important implications. Indeed, as Boyd (2012) discusses, individuals may be viewed by others as more accountable when they have to make their identity known and are unable to stay anonymous online. Additionally, when individuals can conceal their identity they are likely to engage in more aggressive forms of communication (Hutchens et al., 2015). Altogether, the features of Reddit allows individuals who do not want to actively and publicly participate a way to still contribute to what content is popularized (Kilgo et al., 2018). In the context of problematic content, the voting system may be a positive technical feature by allowing users the ability to downvote harmful content without fear of retaliation. However, that only works in communities where the norm is to punish problematic content. In subreddits where that type of content is tolerated or encouraged, the voting system can lead to hate related or toxic content being anonymously pushed to the top of what a user might view. Indeed, an emerging area of research has begun to explore the reasons and content behind Reddit's issues with hate speech (for a review see Massanari, 2020). In a sample of individual users on Reddit, 43% were found to be those who steadily used or gradually started to use more toxic comments over time (Mall et al., 2020). Other research points to communities that discuss discriminatory views related to race/ethnicity and politics that have become popular on Reddit (Topinka, 2018; Gaudette et al., 2020; Mittos et al., 2020). Subreddits identified for their sexist concentration on Men's rights and anti-feminist activism also contribute to harmful dynamics (Massanari, 2017; LaViolette and Hogan, 2019). Common across hate related topics on this platform is the use of negative language to both form an ingroup identity and create toxic conversations around “others” or outgroups. Indeed, on the subreddit r/The_Donald users were found to use hostile language by describing Muslim immigrants as terror threats to western civilization (Gaudette et al., 2020). While Reddit has attempted to crack down and moderate explicitly racist, sexist, and hate speech content (Chandrasekharan et al., 2017, 2020) much of it is still present and available to be viewed by individuals on this platform. Exposure to uncivil language in online communities is important as it can have an effect on other users. Specific to Reddit, toxic language is associated with a comment receiving more direct replies (Xia et al., 2020). Toxic comments were also found to be positively associated with a higher user score (e.g., upvotes compared to downvotes) in some subreddits. This is problematic as it can lead to negative content having a more influential or prominent spot within networks of information online (Chipidza, 2021). While much of this research employs cross sectional or big data approaches, experimental evidence finds that when shown comments on social media that are considered highly toxic participants in turn are more likely to also write toxic comments themselves (Kim et al., 2020). This relationship was not found when participants were exposed to civil comments. Altogether the literature indicates that negative language online can have a contagion effect that has a harmful influence on those exposed to this content (Gervais, 2015; Anderson et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2020). Relevant to the present study, if individuals regularly view uncivil language related to real world events on Reddit this could have implications for both how they understand these events as well as how they engage with the content surrounding them. However, to this point little research has examined 1) if the incivility of language changes before and after events in the real world on platforms such as Reddit, 2) whether these shifts in language are durable or last after the event occurs, or 3) provided an examination of this process across the most recent year of data (e.g., 2020 and early 2021). Considering the political and social volatility in 2020, it is likely that real world events and experiences were regularly discussed across digital media websites. One function of social media is for individuals to share their thoughts, opinions, and experiences about what is happening in the real world with those in the digital world. This leads to the events of the real-world guiding topics of conversation online and is especially true in the context of politics. For example, the 2016 Presidential election was recognized for being highly contentious (American Psychological Association, 2020). The heightened tension and support of the candidates in the real world was found to subsequently occur in the digital world as well. Indeed, in the subreddit for Donald Trump individuals were consistently supportive of his candidacy over the election cycle, whereas support for Hillary Clinton in her subreddit trended negatively over time (Hale and Grabe, 2018). Other studies examining incivility on platforms like Reddit show that political content has become significantly more offensive since the start of the 2016 Presidential election (Nithyanand et al., 2017a). More specifically, while the amount of uncivil apolitical comments has stayed steady, the number of uncivil political comments has increased since 2016 (Nithyanand et al., 2017b). Interestingly, Nithyanand et al. (2017a) also find that when Trump did well in the polls this was positively related to increased incivility online. Of course, this boost in negative content is likely coming from different directions and as both pushback from his opponents and support from other like-minded conservatives. Altogether, this is an example of how the relationship between what is happening in the real world can trickle into the ways in which individuals interact in the digital world. However, data from Nithyanand et al. (2017a,b) is focused on large trends in language through 2017 (e.g., the end of Donald Trump's first presidential election) and is primarily focused on presidential politics. In other words, less is known about if trends of negativity, incivility, and content on platforms such as Reddit are currently playing out in a similar manner. Considering this, a strong argument can be made that an updated analysis is needed around the 2020 Presidential election and discussions online. Additionally, much of the previous research has focused on trends over time (e.g., a large number of years) or around specific political events. While an examination of language across a number of years and political events is important, it is also critical to investigate language in the context of social events too. For example, it is likely that events in the recent past, such as the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent national protests, as well as current events like the COVID-19 pandemic also affect conversations on social media. Indeed, an investigation of language online before and after both political and social events in the real world provides a more precise understanding of how individual events influence discourse and horizontal communication on digital platforms. As discussed above, throughout the year 2020 and into 2021, a large number of critical social and political events took place. The present research provides an examination into how these influential moments in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 shaped discussions along with language online. Given the outlined literature above, we propose the following research questions. RQ1: How does the negativity and positivity of the tone in online content change in response to real world events? RQ2: How does incivility in online content change in response to real world events? Further, we anticipate that these problematic communities are also havens of election disinformation and conspiracy theories. Consequently, content about election overturning, voting conspiracies, and related topics will be prevalent on these subreddits. Accordingly, we make the following prediction. H1: Election, voting, and overturning content will increase as a share of all content in the subreddits examined between the 2020 Presidential election and the insurrection at the capitol on January 6th, 2021. Like many social media sites, Reddit has an API that users can access and collect data from. This particular API allows access to a variety of endpoints, including subreddit posts and the corresponding comments. We began our data collection process by creating a list of over 400 subreddits. Our list was self-created and is based on a variety of different sources. First, we collected subreddits from lists maintained by anti-hate subreddits. The primary list came from r/AgainstHateSubreddits in an, unfortunately, since deleted post.3 In addition, we spent time looking through various political subreddits4 and other aggregations of problematic communities.5 It is by no means comprehensive and is skewed toward those pages that have been identified by other users of Reddit. Moreover, our selection criteria relied on qualitatively evaluating the subreddits for their content to see if they warranted inclusion. We discuss the implications of this process toward the end of the paper. That being said, it is a reasonable starting point and covers most of the most commonly cited problematic pages. A number of these subreddits were unavailable for data collection for a variety of reasons. Including having been shut down or quarantined by Reddit, while others were deleted or made private. Consequently, this left us with 65 subreddits that we were able to access through the Reddit API. From these 65, we collected posts from January 14th, 2020, until January 11th, 2021, giving us a total of 55,797 posts and 5,087,644 comments.6 As discussed above, we were primarily interested in how major political and social events influence the language in problematic communities. As such, we examined the language associated with events, how language changes, and the durability of these changes afterwards. In order to do so, we employed structural topic modeling (STM). This is a powerful tool that looks at the co-occurrence of words in our corpus and classifies them into themes, or topics. One of the key advantages of STM is that it allows us to structure our results at the document level, meaning that we can use the associated metadata to organize results. Put simply, STM lets us evaluate how language changes across these communities based on the posting time and subreddit. Running the STM requires some pre-processing of the text to yield understandable topics. This included the removal of topically meaningless text (emoticons, URLs, etc.) as well as stopwords. From here, we made the decision to stem the remaining text (e.g., conspiracy becomes conspiraci).7 While the subsequent analyses rely on spectral initialization (Mimno and Lee, 2014; Roberts et al., 2019), we include a series of optimization tests in the Appendix. Briefly, for comments we used a random sample of 10,000 drawn from the dataset. We began with the fixed beta and varied the K values (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140) that are around the K produced by the spectral initialization (73). We then used a fixed K of 73 and varied the alpha (0.01, 0.05, 0.1). These models are included in the Appendix along with the top-7 words that distinguish each of the topics. These diagnostics confirm the validity of using the spectral initialization and default meta variables. In addition to our machine learning models, we also employ the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD, Young and Soroka, 2012) to evaluate the tone of our corpus as well as the incivility dictionary from Muddiman et al. (2019). The LSD is a widely used tool for evaluating sentiment (Murthy, 2015; Sabel and Dal Cin, 2016; Soroka et al., 2018). Functionally, the LSD uses a positive and negative word dictionary with each word coded in every post title, text, and comment as either positive or negative based on their presence in the dictionary. Negative words are coded as −1 with positive words coded as 1, which are then summed across the entire text of each observation and divided by the number of positive words, minus the number of negative words, all divided by the total number of words in the text. For instance, the sentence: “They Hate Us” would be coded as zero positive words minus one negative word divided by three total words, for a total score of −0.33. Each post text, post title, and comment were assigned a sentiment score, with mean scores of −0.397 and a median of 0. Here, higher numbers represent more positive sentiment whereas negative numbers indicate more negative sentiment.8 For incivility, we employ a similar strategy of counting the number of words that appear from the incivility dictionary developed by Muddiman and colleagues (2019). After counting the number of words from the dictionary that appear in the text, we then divide that number by the total number of words in the text then multiplied by 100. Higher numbers indicate more incivility with the total corpus having a mean of 0.758 and a median score of 0. To start, we first examined the distribution of posts and comments over our time window. Figures 1, 2 show the posting and commenting frequency along with vertical lines indicating the three major events we were interested in. The line represents a moving average of a 7-day window for each day in our corpus. What the data show is a relatively steady stream of posting behavior for most of the year with the murder of George Floyd on May 25th, and the subsequent release of recorded footage the next day, producing a small uptick. As the presidential election nears, posting slowly then more dramatically increases, leading up to a huge spike in posts before and after the January 6th Capitol assault. For commenting behavior, the largest increases come during the election, as well as another large jump associated with the Capitol assault. Here, George Floyd does not drive as many comments as our other major events do. Figure 1. Post count by day. Figure 2. Comment count by day. Posting and commenting behavior give us some insights into how these problematic groups responded to major events. The Capitol assault was, by far, the most posted about event over the roughly 1 year of our time window. What is also noteworthy is the ramping up that occurred before the assault itself. Posting behavior notably changed right before the election and continuously increased leading up to the actual attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. This suggests that the Capitol assault was not an isolated event in these communities, but the culmination of a period of increasing engagement and discussion. This is not surprising of course, as from the election onwards there were a series of events that took place both as part of the regular election schedule and as a result of both the closeness of the election and Trump's attempts to subvert the process of a peaceful exchange of power. Each likely contributed to the ongoing dialogs identified in our corpus. That being said, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate shifts in content around these events. Consequently, we now turn to how sentiment, or tone, responds to these events. As noted above, these analyses used the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary. Figures 3, 4 below show the overall trend in tone across our corpora. Due to high variation in individual day tone, especially for posts, we smooth the line over a 7-day window.9 Post and comment tone is an aggregate of all content on that day. Negative numbers indicate negative content and positive numbers are positive content. What we are looking at is the relative changes in tone. For instance, post content is relatively positive, but events cause changes in the overall sentiment of the text. Therefore, some interesting dynamics immediately stand out. Post tone takes a large drop immediately following the murder of George Floyd in May of 2020. Conversely, we see an uptick in tone of comments and posts leading up to, but not following the presidential election. Overall trends reflect a priori expectations regarding how the members of these communities might respond to the specific events we examined. Figure 3. Post tone by day. Figure 4. Comment tone by day. Thus far we have identified that major events precipitate changes in tone and that those changes last for extended periods of time post-event. Notably, the murder of George Floyd resulted in a shift in overall tone that did not quite reach back to pre-event levels until multiple months later. Alone the figures are rather striking, but we supplement these with interrupted time series analyses (ITSA) for both posts and comments around the George Floyd murder as additional evidence. Using ITSA allows us to isolate the effect of an event on the trend line of tone. We first subset the dataset to the 2 months before and 2 months after the murder and then code the event (equal to 1) as the 7 days after George Floyd was killed. We use the week after for our event as both search trends from Google indicate that attention waned significantly after this time and according to Chen et al. (2007) news events are often about a week. The ITSA produces significant variation between time periods for tone (p < 0.001, see Table 1), as shown in Figure 5.10 Table 1. ANOVA results for comment tone. Figure 5.

Yet, the relationship between toxicity and news topics is poorly understood. To analyze how news topics relate to the toxicity of user comments, we classify topics of 63,886 online news videos of a large news channel using a neural network and topical tags used by journalists to label content. We score 320,246 user comments from those videos for toxicity and compare how the average toxicity of comments varies by topic. Findings show that topics like Racism, Israel-Palestine, and War & Conflict have more toxicity in the comments, and topics such as Science & Technology, Environment & Weather, and Arts & Culture have less toxic commenting. Qualitative analysis reveals five themes: Graphic videos, Humanistic stories, History and historical facts, Media as a manipulator, and Religion. We also observe cases where a typically more toxic topic becomes non-toxic and where a typically less toxic topic becomes “toxicified” when it involves sensitive elements, such as politics and religion. Findings suggest that news comment toxicity can be characterized as topic-driven toxicity that targets topics rather than as vindictive toxicity that targets users or groups. Practical implications suggest that humanistic framing of the news story (i.e., reporting stories through real everyday people) can reduce toxicity in the comments of an otherwise toxic topic.

Online toxicity, defined as hateful communication that is likely to cause an individual user leave a discussion [1], can manifest itself in various ways, including cyberbullying [2], trolling [3], and the creation of online firestorms, defined as “rapid discharges of large quantities of negative, often highly emotional posts in the social media environment” [4] (p. 286), where participants attack other groups or organizations. According to Patton et al. [5], online toxicity may result in violent actions also in the physical world and should, therefore, be treated as a matter with serious social gravity. Online hate speech is can be seen as old as the Internet itself. Anti-Semitic and racist hate groups were active on Bulletin Board Systems as early as 1984 [6]. In the present time, some communities are specifically geared towards promoting hate speech and providing avenues for expressing politically incorrect values that may not comfortably be expressed in face-to-face interactions [7,8]. Toxic commenting has also been found prevalent in general online discussion forums, news websites, and social media platforms. The existing research deals with multiple aspects, such as detection and classification of toxicity [9–11], assessing its impact on online communities [12,13], types of toxicity such as cyberbullying and trolling [2,14], and means of defusing online toxicity [15]. To approach toxicity, researchers have investigated multiple social media platforms, such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit [7,11], as well as comments in online discussion forums and news websites [16]. Due to its high prevalence, toxicity has been identified as a key concern for the health of online communities. Additionally, previous research has identified several risks from new technology to news dissemination and journalism, including clickbait journalism [17], fake news [18], manipulation of search rankings and results to alter public opinion [19,20], and “story hijacking”, i.e., repurposing the original story [4]. For example, when the New York Police Department (NYPD) invited the community to share positive experiences, the move backfired, and 70 000 tweets of police brutality were shared alongside the hashtag #MyNYPD [4]. Despite the large amount of research focused on these two areas–online toxicity and the negative impact of technology on news–the relationship between news topics and online toxicity remains an unexplored research question. Even though prior research suggests an association between news topics and toxic comments, this association has not been empirically established. The previous studies suggest that political topics can cause hateful debates when associated with group polarization [21], i.e., a strong division to opposing groups among online users. In their study, Zhang et al. [22] considered topic as a feature in machine learning but did not provide an analysis of the relationship between different topics and toxicity. Despite implicative evidence of the relationship between news topics and online hate, toxicity of the comments of online news content has not been systematically analyzed by news topic in previous research. It is this research gap that we aim to address. We specifically investigate a concept that we refer to as online news toxicity, defined as toxic commenting taking place in relation to online news. Our aim is to analyze if different topics result in varying levels of toxic commenting. For this, we pose the following research questions: To address these questions, machine learning provides value, as it facilitates dealing with large-scale online data [11,23]. We address RQ1 by collecting a large dataset of YouTube news videos and all comments of those videos. We then topically classify the stories using supervised machine learning, and score each comment using a publicly available toxicity scoring service that has been trained using millions of social media comments. Using these two variables–toxicity and topic–we quantitatively analyze how toxicity varies by news topic. To address RQ2, we conduct an in-depth qualitative analysis of the relationship between content type and toxicity. We conclude by discussing the implications for journalists and other stakeholders and outlining future research directions. The focus on the online news context is important for a variety of reasons. First, because of the impact that news stories have in the society in shaping citizen’s worldview and the quality of public discourse [24]. Second, understanding toxic responses to online news stories matters to many stakeholder groups within the media profession, including online news and media organizations, content producers, journalists and editors, who struggle to make sense of the impact of their stories on the wider stratosphere of social media. Third, in the era of mischievous strategies for getting public attention, it is becoming increasingly difficult for news media to provide facts without seen as a manipulator or stakeholder in the debate itself. Previous research on online hate, suggest that toxicity is especially prevalent in online news media [11]. In the present time, news channels cannot isolate themselves from the audience reactions, but analyzing these reactions is important to understand the various sources of digital bias and to form an analytical relationship to the audience. Finally, the betterment of online experiences by mitigating online toxicity is a matter of societal impact, as toxic conversations impact nearly all online users across social media platforms [10,12,25]. In online environments, toxic behavior is often seen enhanced by the fact that participants can typically comment anonymously and are not held accountable for their behavior in the same way as in offline interactions [3]. Online communities for marginalized or vulnerable groups are particularly exposed to online toxicity because discriminatory patterns, including sexism and racism, tend to be perpetuated and exacerbated online [26]. While inclusivity, accessibility and low barriers to entry have increased individual and citizen participation and the associated public debate on matters of social importance, toxic discussions show the cost of having low barriers or supervision for online participation. Because everyone can participate, also the people with toxic views are participating. Some studies highlight democracy of online environments as a contributing factor of online controversies [4,27]. Because the Internet brings together people with different backgrounds and allows a space for people to interact that do not normally interact with each other, an environment is created where contrasting attitudes and points of view are conflicting and colliding. Another explanation for online toxicity is that, even though online environments give unprecedented access to differing views and information, people tend to actively filter out information that is contrasting their existing views [21] and seek the company of like-minded individuals, forming closed “echo chambers”. These echo chambers are environments where like-minded people reinforce each other’s views, either without exposure to the views of the opposing side or seeing these views as the target of ridicule from the perspective of the shared narrative of the community [28]. Furthermore, the echo chambers may result in group polarization, in which a previously held moderate belief (e.g., “I’m not sure about the motives of the refugees”) is taking a more extreme form following the more radical elements of the community (e.g., “refugees are not really escaping violence but to get free social benefits”). A fundamental question that scholars investigating online hate are asking is whether online environments lend themselves sui generis to provocative and harassing behavior. Khorasani [29] notes that, like their counterparts in actual social networks, participants in online groups “make friendships and argue with each other and become involved in long and tedious conflicts and controversies” (p. 2). Moule et al. [30] observe, however, that online environments have created new forms of socialization and have forged changes in intra- and inter-group relations. Hardaker [3] argues that the relative anonymity provided in online exchanges “may encourage a sense of impunity and freedom from being held accountable for inappropriate online behaviour” [sic] (p. 215). In a similar vein, Chatzakou et al. [31] observe that because of the pseudo-anonymity of online platforms, people tend to express their viewpoints with less inhibition than they would in face-to-face interactions. Patton et al. [5] note the reciprocal relationship between online and offline violence. The low barriers of entry of online environments, they argue, have changed how peer-to-peer relationships are managed [5]. In sum, these previous findings support and stress the need for research on online toxicity. Prior research has found that certain topics are more controversial than others (see Table 1). These include nationalism [29,32], sexism [31], agricultural policies [33], climate change (ibid.), religious differences (ibid.), defense [34], foreign policy (ibid.), intelligence agencies (ibid.), politician’s characteristics/personality traits (ibid.), energy [35], vaccination [19], fake news [19], and gun control [26,34]. For example, Kittur et al. [27] found that Wikipedia articles on well-known people, religion and philosophy involved more controversy and conflict. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228723.t001 In general, the intersects between users’ commenting behaviour and the topic of news items are not yet well understood, even though some studies on negative user behavior explicate the link between topics and toxic commenting. It has been found that although controversial political or social topics typically generate more user comments, users often read news comments for their entertainment value rather than in response to the news article itself [43]. Another study found that writers of toxic comments rearticulated the meaning of news items to produce hate against a marginalized group, even if that group was not the topic of the news [44]. Although existing research on negative online behavior has implications for the research questions posed in this study, the relationship between online news topics and the toxicity of user comments has not been studied directly and systematically. The closest study we could locate is by Ksiazek [34] who offers a content analysis of news stories and user comments across twenty news websites with the aim of predicting the volume of comments and their relative quality in terms of civility and hostility. Hostility was defined as comments “intentionally designed to attack someone or something and, in doing so, incite anger or exasperation through the use of name-calling, character assassination, offensive language, profanity, and/or insulting language” [34] (p. 854). The study found that news stories about the economy, government inefficiency, immigration, gun control, defense, foreign policy, intelligence agencies, and politicians’ personality traits are more prone to elicit hostile discussion. Several other studies have treated the relationship between topic and toxicity implicitly. Wang and Liu [45] find support for readers’ varied emotional reactions specifically to news articles, while Salminen et al. [11] analyze the targets of online hate and find that media is targeted frequently in their dataset. Drawing on sociolinguistics and the social pragmatics of politeness, Zhang et al. [22] study some of the “warning signs” in the context of English Wikipedia that may indicate that an online conversation that started civil is about to derail. However, their study is explicitly topic-agnostic, as it disregards the influence of topic and focuses solely on the presence of rhetorical devices in online comments. Most notably, these earlier studies did not perform a topical analysis of the content. To extend the online research toxicity, we conduct a topical analysis to better understand the audience’s toxic responses to online news content. Although the relationship between news topics and online toxicity has not been systematically investigated, the broader literature on online hate speech suggests that topic sits within a host of other factors, all of which contribute to understanding the phenomenon of toxicity in online commenting. These studies point to the need for a deeper analysis of the intersects of personal values, group membership, and topic. While this study focuses only on the relationship between topic and toxicity, it is conducted with the understanding that the results provide a springboard for further research on the complex nature of toxic online commenting. We use machine learning to classify the topics of the news videos. For this, we use a fully connected Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) that is a simple and widely used classification architecture [46]. We then score the toxicity of the comments automatically using a publicly available API service. The use of computational techniques is important because the sheer number of videos and comments makes their manual processing unfeasible. In this research, we utilize the website content, tagged for topics, to automatically classify the YouTube videos of the same organization that lack the topic labels. In other words, the FFNN is trained on textual articles from organization’s website, which are tagged with topic labels, and then used to predict the topics of YouTube videos, using their titles and descriptions. To answer our research question, we need to classify the videos because videos include user comments whose toxicity we are interested in. We then score each comment in each video for toxicity and carry out statistical testing to explore the differences of toxicity between topics. Additionally, we conduct a qualitative analysis to better understand the reasons for toxicity in the comments. Our research context is Al Jazeera Media Network (AJ), a large international news and media organization that reports news topics on the website and on various social media platforms. Overall, AJ is a reputable news organization, internationally recognized for its journalism. However, from the content, we can see that the channel’s content has a “liberal” undertone that can be associated with political polarization between right and left, especially prominent in social media in the wake of the US presidential campaign in 2016 [47]. Previous research on toxicity in the organization’s social media comments [11] has shown that AJ’s content attracts a high number of toxic commenting. This can partly be explained by the fact that the audience consists of viewers from more than 150 countries, forming a diverse mix of ethnicities, cultures, social and demographic backgrounds. Previous literature implies that such a mix likely results in conflicts. At the same time, the organization represents an interesting research context as it reports news on a wide range of serious topics and is not geographically restricted–for example, AJ covers US politics but also international politics, European affairs and so on. However, this excludes entertainment and sports (apart from major sports events such as World Cup of football). For this reason, we characterize the content as “serious news” and consider the wide range of topics and diversity of the audience as well as the associated high prevalence of toxic commenting suitable for the purpose of this study. We collect two types of data from the news content (see Table 2): text content from news stories published in English on Al Jazeera’s (a) website (https://www.dropbox.com/s/keccjwuz0ruyztt/website%20data%20collection%20script.txt?dl=0) and (b) AJ+, one of the organization’s YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV3Nm3T-XAgVhKH9jT0ViRg). The website has more than 15M monthly visits, and the YouTube channel has more than 500,000 subscribers (August 2019). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228723.t002 For YouTube data collection, we use the official YouTube Analytics API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/analytics/) with the channel owner’s permission and in compliance with YouTube’s terms of service. From YouTube, we retrieve all 33,996 available (through September 2018) videos with their titles, descriptions, and comments. The comments in this channel are not actively moderated, which provides a good dataset of the unfiltered reactions of the commentators. We collect the news stories using a Python script that retrieves the HTML content of new stories from the news organization’s website (see S1 File), including information about the article’s content, title, publication date, and topics. The website data contains 21,709 news articles, of which 13,058 (60.2%) have been manually tagged by AJ’s journalists and editors for topical keywords. Overall, there are 801 topical keywords used by the journalists to categorize the news articles. This tagging is done to improve the search-engine indexing of the news stories, so that the tags are placed in the content management system upon publishing the news story to characterize the content with topically descriptive tags, such as “racism”, “environment”, “US elections”, and so on. The HTML content from the website contains some unnecessary information for the classification task, such as JavaScript functions, file directories, hypertext marking (HTML), white spaces, non-alphabetical characters, and stop words (i.e., common English words such as ‘and’, ‘of’ that provide little discriminative value). These add no information for the classifier algorithm and are thus removed. As machine learning models take numbers as input [48], we convert our articles into numbers using the Term Frequency–Inverted Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique that counts the number of instances each unique word appears in each content piece. TF-IDF scores each word based on how common the word is in a given content piece, and how uncommon it is across all content pieces [49]. We then convert the cleaned articles into a TF-IDF matrix, excluding the most common and rarest words. Finally, we assign training data and ground-truth labels using a topic-count matrix. We use the cleaned website text content, along with the topics, to train a neural network classifier that classifies the collected videos for news topics. Note that the contribution of this paper is not to present a novel method but rather to apply well-established machine learning methods to our research problem. To this end, we develop an FFNN model using the Keras, a publicly available Python Deep Learning library (http://keras.io) that enables us to create the FFNN architecture (a fully connected two-layer network). Additionally, we create a custom class to cross-validate and evaluate the FFNN, since Keras does not provide support for cross-validation by default. This is needed because cross-validation is an important step for ensuring that machine learning results are correct [50]. Training of the FFNN was done using the website data because the journalists have actively labeled the news articles for topics using their content management system that generates the topics as “news keywords” that can be automatically retrieved from the HTML source code. The YouTube content is not tagged, only containing generic classes chosen when uploading the videos on YouTube. The topics created by the journalists are crucial because journalists are considered as subject-matter experts of news, and the use of expert-labeled data generally improves the performance of supervised machine learning [51], because human expertise is helpful for the model to detect patterns from the data. From a technical point of view, this is a multilabel classification problem, as one news article is typically labeled for several topics. Note, however, that for statistical testing we only utilize the highest-ranking topic per a news story. More specifically, the output of the FFNN classifier is a matrix of confidence values for the combination of each news story and each topic. Of these, the chosen topics are the ones exceeding a set threshold value for the confidence–in our case, we use the commonly applied value of 0.5 for testing and, for statistical, we choose the topic with the highest confidence value. In other words, a story has only one “dominant” topic in the statistical analysis. This is done for parsimony, as using all or several topics per story would make the statistical comparison exceedingly complex. Here, we report the key evaluation methods and results of the topic classification. Note that a full evaluation study of the applied FFNN classifier is presented in Salminen et al. [48]. First, to optimize the parameters of the FFNN model, we create a helper class to conduct random optimization on both the TF-IDF matrix creation and the FFNN parameters. Subsequently, we identify a combination of FFNN parameters in the search space that provides the highest F1 Score (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall). This combination is used to fine-tune the model parameters, and we obtain a solid performance (F1FFNN = 0.700). By “solid,” we mean that the results are satisfactory for this study, so that the accuracy of our algorithm is considerably higher than the probability of choosing the right topic by random chance (p = 1 / 799 ≈ 0.1%). FFNN also clearly outperforms a Random Forest (RF) model that was tested as a baseline model (F1RF = 0.458). As an alternative to the supervised methods, we also experimented with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised topic modeling approach [52]. LDA infers latent patterns (“topics”) from the distribution of words in a corpus [53]. For brevity, we exclude the results of these experiments from the manuscript; a manual inspection showed that the automatically inferred LDA topics are less meaningful and interpretable as the news keywords handpicked by the journalists working for the organization whose content we are analyzing. Therefore, we do not use LDA but rather train a supervised classifier based on manually annotated data by journalists that can be considered as experts of news topics. The importance of using domain experts for data annotation is widely acknowledged in machine learning literature [54,55]. Generally, expert taxonomies are considered as gold standards for classification [56]. We apply the model trained on website content (i.e., the cleaned article text) is applied to video content (i.e., the concatenated title and description text). Intuitively, we presume this approach works because the news topics covered in the YouTube channel are highly similar to those published on the website (e.g., covering a lot of political and international topics). Because we lack ground truth (there are no labels in the videos), we evaluate the validity of the machine-classified results by using three human coders to classify a sample of 500 videos using the same taxonomy that the machine applied. We then measure the simple agreement between the chosen topics by machine and human raters and find that the average agreement between the three human raters and the machine is 70.4%. Considering the high number of classes, we are satisfied with this result. In terms of success rate, the model provided a label for 96.1% of the content (i.e., 32,678 out of 33,996 YouTube videos). Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has launched an initiative, the Perspective API, aimed at preventing online harassment and providing safer environments for user discussions via the detection of toxic comments. Perspective API has been trained on millions of online comments using semi-supervised methods to capture the toxicity of online comments in various contexts [1]. Perspective API (https://perspectiveapi.com) defines a toxic comment as “a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion” [57]. This definition is relevant to our research, since it specifically focuses on online comments of which our dataset consists. Note that Perspective API is a publicly available service for toxicity prediction of social media comments, enabling replicability of the scoring process. We utilize the Perspective API to score the comments collected for this study. After obtaining an access key to the API, we test its performance. The version of the API at the time of the study had two main types of models: (a) alpha models and (b) experimental models. The alpha models include the default toxicity scoring model, while the experimental models include the severe toxicity, fast toxicity, attack on author, attack on commenter, incoherent (i.e., difficult to comprehend), inflammatory (provocative), likely to reject (according to New York Times moderation guidelines), obscene, spam, and unsubstantial (i.e., short comments). In this research, we use the alpha category’s default toxicity model that returns a score between 0 and 1, where 1 is the maximum toxicity. According to the Perspective API’s documentation, the returned scores represent toxicity probability, i.e., how likely a comment is perceived to be toxic by online users. To retrieve the toxicity scores, we sent the 320,246 comments to Perspective API; however, the tool returned some blank values. According to the API documentation, failure to provide scores can be due to non-English content, and too long comments. Overall, we were able to successfully score 240,554 comments, representing 78.2% of the comments in the dataset. A manual inspection showed that Perspective API was able to detect the toxicity of the comments well. To further establish the validity of the automatic scoring of Perspective API, we conducted a manual rating on a random sample of 150 comments. A trained research assistant determined if a comment is hateful or not (yes/no), and we compared this rating to the score of Perspective API. We use the threshold of 0.5 so that comments below that threshold are considered non-toxic and comments above toxic (note that this is comparable to the decision threshold of the classifier, also 0.5). We obtained a percentage agreement of 76.7% between the human annotator and the score given by Perspective API, which we deem reasonable for this study. We also computed Cohen’s Kappa that considers the probability of agreeing by chance. In total, there were 135 agreements (90% of the observations), whereas the number of agreements expected by chance would have been 118.5 (79% of the observations). The obtained Kappa metric of κ = 0.524 indicates a “moderate” agreement [58]. While the score would ideally be higher, we consider it acceptable for this study, especially given the evidence that toxicity ratings are highly subjective in the real world [59,60]. After scoring the video comments, we associate each comment with a topic from its video. As the toxicity score of each comment is known, we simply calculate the average toxicity score of the comments of a given video. After this, we have obtained the average toxicity score for each video based on its comments’ toxicity. Because we also have the topic of each video classified using the FFNN, taking the average score of all the videos within a given topic returns the average toxicity score of that topic. To simplify the statistical analysis, we reduce the number of classes by grouping similar topics under one theme (“superclass”). Thus, we group people into countries, countries into continents, and similar themes under one topic. In most cases, we kept the original names given by the journalists to the topics, only adding another topic. For example, Environment, Climate SOS and Weather became Environment & Weather. We grouped country names under continents. Many observations for Middle Eastern countries caused the creation of a separate superclass Middle East. Likewise, Israel, Palestine, and Gaza were grouped into the superclass Israel-Palestine.

It aimed to identify positive aspects for responsible use and develop initiatives for ethical engagement. Using Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted virtually via Zoom, the research involved 10 college students from various institutions in Metro Manila, ensuring diverse viewpoints. Thematic analysis guided by Braun and Clarke’s six-step process was employed, supported by real cancel culture cases to enrich discussions. Participants viewed cancel culture as flawed for accountability, preferring education over condemnation. While it can promote social justice, it often normalizes bullying and stifles open discourse, driven by a desire for quick justice and peer pressure. They advocated for dialogue and personal growth instead of punitive measures, stressing the importance of context and mitigating circumstances. Cancel culture should be a last resort, applied with a nuanced approach considering the severity of offenses and opportunities for reform. Though it raises awareness and addresses social issues, responsible use should prioritize education and restorative justice. Cancel culture influences societal norms and accountability perceptions by setting behavior standards, often focusing on internal attributions and character flaws, leading to harsh judgments. In contrast, restorative justice emphasizes empathy, understanding, and reconciliation over punitive measures, promoting meaningful dialogue and collective responsibility, essential for building supportive communities. Keywords: Cancel Culture, Restorative Justice, Compassionate Education, Public Opinion, Youth The digital age has transformed social interaction, with social media platforms becoming central to online engagement (Velasco, 2020). These platforms enable self-expression, community building, and social movement mobilization. Social media platforms are the primary arena for cancel culture, amplifying its reach and impact. The speed and scale of digital communication enable rapid mobilization but often lack mechanisms for accountability or reconciliation (Marwick, 2020). Furthermore, the algorithms of social media platforms can exacerbate polarization, as they prioritize content that generates engagement, including outrage and conflict (Tufekci, 2018). Cancel Culture in the Digital Age Cancel culture in the digital age raises concerns about due process and the presumption of innocence, as individuals can face public condemnation and professional repercussions without a fair assessment of the accusations. This undermines the principles of fairness and justice essential to a functioning legal system and ethical society. However, cancel culture also holds potential as a tool for promoting social justice by holding individuals accountable for harmful actions (Jusay et al., 2022). Studies show that cancel culture can lead to severe consequences, including harassment and suicidal thoughts, particularly for celebrities and public figures (Infante et al., 2022). Despite its negative aspects, some view cancel culture as a way to advocate for social justice when other options seem unavailable, seeing it as a pathway for positive change by holding people accountable without defining their entire life by a single mistake (Wychunas, 2021). Understanding the nuanced perceptions of cancel culture is crucial for comprehending its impact on sociocultural dynamics and fostering a more informed and tolerant online environment to mitigate its potential harms. Cancel culture, defined as public shaming and ostracism for perceived offenses, has become a notable phenomenon within this digital landscape (Velasco, 2020). Cancel culture is a contemporary phenomenon often defined as the practice of withdrawing support for public figures, organizations, or individuals who have expressed or engaged in behavior perceived as offensive or harmful. It embodies a blend of social justice activism, accountability, and public discourse. However, its nuances reveal complexities that warrant further exploration. While often criticized for creating hostile environments and leading to self-censorship (Vallete, 2021; Roos, 2020), cancel culture can also hold individuals and institutions accountable, promoting social justice and equity (Jusay et al., 2022), especially in cases where legal or institutional mechanisms fail to address injustices (Ng, 2020). For marginalized communities, cancel culture provides a platform to amplify their voices and highlight systemic issues. However, critics argue that cancel culture can devolve into mob mentality, where online shaming and harassment overshadow constructive dialogue (Clark, 2020). This tension between accountability and overreach underscores the need for measured approaches to public critique. Power Dynamics in Cancel Culture Another significant nuance is the interplay of power dynamics. Cancel culture often emerges as a response to perceived abuses of power, yet it also reveals how power is redistributed in digital spaces. Public figures with significant platforms may face backlash disproportionate to their actions, while lesser-known individuals may experience devastating personal consequences (Nguyen, 2021). This dynamic complicates the ethics of cancel culture and raises questions about the fairness of its outcomes. Cultural and Generational Perspectives Cancel culture is perceived differently across cultural and generational lines. Younger generations often view it as a necessary tool for social change, while older generations may see it as an erosion of free speech and due process (Williams, 2021). However, there is a significant gap in understanding young adults’ perceptions of cancel culture, despite their high social media activity and formative developmental stages (Statista, 2022). Additionally, cultural contexts influence the thresholds for cancellation, as norms and values vary significantly across societies (Chen, 2022). These differences illustrate that cancel culture is not a monolithic concept but rather a reflection of broader societal debates. Pathways to Reconciliation While cancel culture often focuses on punishment, some scholars advocate for integrating restorative justice principles. By fostering dialogue and understanding, restorative approaches could address harm while promoting growth and accountability (Drexler-Dreis, 2021). Such pathways highlight the potential for cancel culture to evolve into a more constructive and inclusive practice. Cancel culture research reveals several key gaps in the literature. These include a lack of cross-cultural perspectives, with most studies focusing on Western contexts (Baek et al., 2021), and a shortage of longitudinal research examining its long-term effects (Ng, 2020). There is also limited understanding of how cancel culture impacts marginalized groups (Clark, 2020), as well as the legal and ethical considerations involved (Heine et al.,2021). More research is needed on the psychological impact of canceling (Martinez & Stewart, 2021), the role of social media platforms and algorithms (Ng, 2020), and the broader political and economic implications (Greene, 2021). Additionally, inconsistent definitions of cancel culture highlight the need for clearer theoretical frameworks to differentiate it from similar concepts like accountability culture and online shaming (Baek et al., 2021). This research aimed to fill this gap by investigating non-Western college students’ perceptions of cancel culture, in response to the gap Baek et al (2021) identified, and its normalization on social media platforms. By examining both its negative and positive aspects, the study sought to identify strategies for responsible engagement to mitigate negative consequences and enhance positive impacts. Ultimately, this research aimed to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of cancel culture’s implications for young people in the digital age, a gap Ng (2020) presented, offering insights to navigate it more ethically, as suggested by Heine et al. (2021) in the absence of laws more informed by research. This study’s ethical trajectory emerging from young adults, particularly the emergent more humane and less judgmental discourses that arise from seeing its positive and negative implications open up a fresh perspective that may not be as theoretically informed as academic discussions but are relevant, nonetheless, since they come from those who are deeply embedded in social media where cancel culture proliferates. Impacts of Cancel Culture Cancel culture has long-term impacts, affecting individuals’ reputations, careers, and social relationships, creating a culture of fear and mistrust (Palomares et al., 2022). It has held public figures accountable, as seen in the Harvey Weinstein case, which sparked the #MeToo movement, empowering victims and highlighting sexual harassment issues (Adrian et al., 2021). However, cancel culture also spreads misinformation and fosters toxic online behavior due to the limitations of social media and anonymity, leading to severe consequences, including harassment and mental health issues (Martinez, 2021; Infante et al., 2023). The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified this trend, with increased online activity leading to cases like that of Cat Arambulo-Antonio in the Philippines (Velasco, 2020). Cancel culture can push for necessary societal changes and initiate critical conversations, but it also raises ethical questions about fairness and the proportionality of its consequences (De La Salle University’s Social Development Research Center, 2022). It emphasizes the power dynamics on platforms like Twitter, where public support determines individuals’ social capital and accountability (Haskell, 2021). Despite its controversies, cancel culture can foster positive change by addressing issues like racism and providing a voice to marginalized communities (Averion et al., 2021; D. Clark, 2020). Perceptions and Attitudes on Cancel Culture Nearly half of Americans view cancel culture as a means to educate and prompt learning from mistakes, while others see it as unfair punishment that disregards context and intent, raising questions about its productivity and necessity (Vogels et al., 2022). Some argue cancel culture empowers individuals to challenge structural inequalities and hold others accountable (Rom & Mitchell, 2021; Dudenhoefer, 2020; Marsh, 2022). However, its complexity involves online humiliation and distorted accountability, with marginalized voices often facing intimidation (Burmah, 2021). While cancel culture can prompt inclusivity and societal shifts, as seen with corporate rebranding efforts (Morgan, 2021), it also creates fear, self-censorship, and hampers free speech, leading to anxiety and severe psychological tolls (De La Salle University’s Social Development Research Center, 2022). Some studies suggest it can empower marginalized groups, yet further research is needed (Traversa et al., 2023). Teacher education programs could help address its negative effects by promoting restorative justice (Zembylas, 2023). The rise of social media amplifies this phenomenon, impacting both individuals and organizations (Infante et al., 2023). Cancel Culture and Public Opinion Cancel culture exerts a significant influence on public opinion by shaping perceptions of individuals, companies, and public figures through social media-driven collective action. It typically involves widespread condemnation and ostracization of individuals or entities perceived to have engaged in offensive behavior or holding controversial views (Infante et al., 2023). This phenomenon can sway public opinion in several ways. Firstly, cancel culture amplifies the visibility of controversies and negative perceptions. Social media platforms serve as catalysts for rapid dissemination of information and opinions, leading to heightened awareness and discussions among the public (Palomares et al., 2021). For instance, a controversial statement or action by a public figure can quickly spark widespread condemnation and calls for accountability, which can influence how the public perceives that individual or issue. Secondly, cancel culture can lead to polarization within society. When a controversy erupts, it often divides public opinion into supporters and critics of the canceled entity. This polarization is evident in debates on social media platforms where individuals express strong opinions either supporting or condemning the actions that led to the cancellation (Jusay et al., 2022). This polarization can influence public discourse and contribute to the formation of echo chambers where like-minded individuals reinforce their beliefs and opinions. Moreover, cancel culture impacts reputations and credibility. Individuals or organizations subjected to cancellation may experience reputational damage, loss of credibility, and even economic consequences due to boycotts or reduced support. The severity of these consequences can vary depending on the nature and scale of the controversy, as well as the responses of the canceled party. As such, cancel culture influences public opinion by amplifying controversies, fostering polarization, and impacting reputations (Infante et al., 2023; Palomares et al., 2021; Jusay et al., 2022). Its influence is predominantly driven by the rapid dissemination of information and opinions on social media platforms, which shape how individuals and issues are perceived in the public sphere. Cancel Culture and Youth Culture Cancel culture exerts profound influence on youth culture by shaping digital interactions, identity formation, and social justice advocacy. It thrives on social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok, where visibility and peer validation drive its dynamics (Statista, 2023; Vogels et al., 2022). This phenomenon impacts how young people express opinions, navigate societal norms, and engage in online discourse, often fostering a climate of conformity and self-censorship to avoid backlash (Marsh, 2022; Traversa et al., 2023). Cancel culture intersects with youth activism, prompting advocacy for social justice causes while challenging traditional power structures (Waani & Wempi, 2021; Zembylas, 2023). However, its prevalence also raises concerns about mental health repercussions, as fear of public condemnation can contribute to anxiety and stress among adolescents (Infante et al., 2023). Educators and parents play pivotal roles in promoting media literacy and fostering critical thinking to help young individuals navigate cancel culture’s complexities (Cherry, 2023; Malle & Korman, 2013). As youth culture evolves, ongoing discourse on the ethical dimensions and psychological impacts of cancel culture remains crucial for cultivating inclusive and respectful digital environments (Norris, 2021; Rom & Mitchell, 2021). Heider’s Attribution Theory Fritz Heider’s (1958) Attribution Theory posited that individuals observed others’ behaviors and formed beliefs about their causes, categorizing these justifications into internal attributions (personal attributes) and external attributions (external factors). This theory was crucial in shaping subjective perceptions of the world, offering a framework for understanding how people interpreted and explained the behavior of others, thus shedding light on the complexities of human intellect and social interaction. Attribution theory intersects with cancel culture in several key ways within current literature. Cancel culture often involves public judgments and attributions of blame or responsibility for perceived wrongdoing. These attributions can be influenced by factors such as intent, social identity, and the severity of the action (Martinez & Stewart, 2021). In cancel culture, people often engage in dispositional attributions, where they attribute the individual’s actions to their character or values, rather than considering situational factors (Ng, 2020). This tendency can intensify public condemnation and the persistence of the canceling process. Additionally, research has shown that the attribution of moral responsibility in cancel culture can be shaped by group membership and power dynamics, with individuals from marginalized groups more likely to experience harsher attributions and consequences (Clark, 2020). On the other hand, situational attributions—where blame is placed on external circumstances—can sometimes lead to more lenient responses, but this is less common in online environments where rapid judgment prevails. Attribution theory, thus, provides a useful lens for understanding how and why certain individuals are canceled, and how factors like intent, perceived harm, and identity influence these judgments. This study explored selected Filipino college students’ perceptions of cancel culture through the lens of Fritz Heider’s Attribution Theory. The framework examined how students perceived the nature of cancellations, considering both internal and external factors. The aim was to understand whether students found the cancellations fair or unfair based on the internal attributes or external factors that influenced their perception of cancel culture. This framework allowed for a nuanced understanding of how students made sense of cancel culture. Statement of the Problem This study aimed to explore college students’ perceptions of cancel culture’s normalization on social media, discuss criteria for a better approach, identify positive aspects to guide responsible use, and develop initiatives for ethical engagement, especially in the education of the young who are mostly in social media where cancel culture proliferates. This paper particularly sought to gain insight into the theoretical and educational implications that emerged from the data. To gain in-depth insights into participants’ experiences and perspectives on cancel culture, this study utilized Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), a qualitative approach that provided a nuanced understanding of these perceptions. The research design involved a qualitative approach to explore and deeply understand college students’ views on cancel culture and its normalization on social media. Conducted virtually via Zoom, the study involved 10 volunteer college students (four females and six males) from various educational institutions in Metro Manila to ensure a diverse range of perspectives, focusing on participants who were active social media users and familiar with cancel culture. The participants did not arrive at sampling saturation as they were volunteers with diverse viewpoints and only those who volunteered after satisfying the criteria were included in the FGD (with or without reaching saturation). Between eight and ten discussants are considered acceptable in a single group FGD (Central Connecticut State University, n.d.). The goal was not to infer or generalize findings which is established through saturation but understand with more depth about the phenomenon. The FGD was central to data collection, providing a means to delve deeply into college students’ views on cancel culture. The key questions pursued in the FGD were as follows: (1) When people online call for others to be “canceled” for offensive comments or bad behavior, do you think this is an effective way to hold them accountable? Why or why not?; (2) Have you ever seen someone get “canceled” on social media? Tell us about a situation you saw and how it made you feel. Did you agree with the cancellation or not? Why or why not?; (3) Why do you think so many people participate in “canceling” others online?; and (4) Do you think “cancel culture” can sometimes get people talking more about important social issues? Why or why not? Can you give an example? The online discussion via Zoom that lasted two hours followed a guide that began with greetings, an orientation on house rules, some disclaimers, and how the FGD will be conducted. Thereafter, the FGD commenced. The discussion was recorded and transcribed verbatim to ensure accurate data capture and qualitative analysis. Participants provided informed consent, emphasizing voluntary participation and the right to withdraw at any time. This methodology allowed for the collection of rich, qualitative insights directly addressing the central focus of the study: understanding youth perspectives on cancel culture. The study employed purposive sampling to select participants, ensuring they were 18 years or older, currently enrolled as college students in Metro Manila, familiar with cancel culture, and active social media users. Research instruments included a pre-screening survey through Google Forms to gather basic information and assess familiarity with cancel culture, and an FGD guide to facilitate discussions. The FGD incorporated presentations of various cancel culture cases to enrich discussions and provide concrete examples for participants to reflect upon. Data from the FGD sessions were analyzed using Thematic Analysis following Braun and Clarke’s (2013) six-step process, which involves familiarizing with the data, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and producing a report. This approach allowed for an in-depth exploration of the data and a comprehensive report supporting data interpretation. The inclusion of cancel culture cases further enriched the analysis, providing a deeper understanding of specific instances and contexts influencing participants’ perspectives on cancel culture. College students’ current perceptions regarding cancel culture and its normalization on social media platforms Effectiveness. Although the students acknowledged that there are certain instances where the act of “canceling” can be warranted, it was generally agreed that participating in “cancel culture” is not the best approach for holding a person accountable for their actions, as education should be the priority. Cancel culture tends to focus more on bringing others down rather than leaving room for growth. Its effectiveness is often debated because, while there are cases where it serves its intended purpose, it also has the potential to encourage individuals to continue harmful behaviors secretly while avoiding public attention to escape consequences, which contradicts the whole idea of accountability. One participant noted: “We’ve seen calls to action for people who have made offensive comments or engaged in illicit behavior. Sometimes it does work. They do change, and there is growth or a sense of making them face the consequences of their actions, but at other times it just causes them to become less noticeable or less public.” According to Jusay et al. (2022), while cancel culture has the power to advocate effectively for social justice and raise awareness about important issues, it also has the potential to normalize bullying culture. The student participants unanimously agreed that, despite instances where cancel culture has been effective, it should be considered a last resort, as it is often characterized by mob mentality. The most ideal course of action is to foster meaningful discourse that educates people and helps them grow out of harmful practices and beliefs. Attribution theory serves as a useful lens for understanding participants’ perspectives on cancel culture, highlighting how individuals often make judgments based on dispositional (internal) versus situational (external) factors. Participants noted that cancel culture tends to promote harsh dispositional attributions, leading to a complete character assessment based on a single mistake, thereby prioritizing punishment over personal growth and understanding. They advocated for education instead of condemnation, emphasizing the importance of considering the broader context behind individuals’ actions. This aligns with the idea that cancel culture can push undesirable behaviors underground, reflecting the fundamental attribution error, where behaviors are judged more on character than context. Participants also expressed concern that cancel culture fosters a mob mentality, where group dynamics simplify attributions, resulting in overly punitive measures that undermine opportunities for reflection and change, reinforcing the necessity for dialogue rather than immediate condemnation. Students’ Definitions of Cancel Culture. For students, cancel culture is often defined as a form of public accountability where individuals or organizations face collective backlash for behaviors or statements deemed offensive or harmful. Students recognize its potential to advocate for social justice and raise awareness of systemic issues, but they also critique its focus on punitive measures over educational opportunities. Jusay et al. (2022) highlight that many students see cancel culture as effective in specific cases but largely problematic due to its tendency to normalize bullying and mob mentality. Participants in the discussions noted that cancel culture prioritizes punishment over education, often overlooking the situational contexts of individuals’ actions. One student reflected: “Sometimes it does work. They do change, and there is growth or a sense of making them face the consequences of their actions, but at other times it just causes them to become less noticeable or less public.” This perspective underscores the duality of cancel culture as both a tool for social change and a mechanism that may inadvertently push harmful behaviors underground, contradicting its intent to promote accountability. Alignment with Societal Understandings. Students’ perspectives on cancel culture align with societal definitions in their recognition of its dual nature—both as a tool for justice and a source of harm. Broader societal discussions similarly highlight cancel culture’s ability to draw attention to injustices while critiquing its often harsh, unforgiving nature (Ng, 2020). Like societal critics, students point out that cancel culture can reinforce the fundamental attribution error, where judgments are disproportionately based on perceived internal flaws rather than contextual factors (Heider, 1958). Attribution theory provides a lens for understanding these dynamics, emphasizing how dispositional attributions dominate in cancel culture, leading to character assessments based on isolated actions. Students echo societal concerns about this oversimplification, advocating for approaches that promote dialogue, education, and growth rather than immediate condemnation. Divergences from Societal Understandings. While students’ definitions reflect many societal critiques, their focus on the role of education as an alternative to cancel culture diverges from broader discourses that often emphasize punitive measures. Students argue that fostering meaningful dialogue is a more effective long-term strategy for addressing harmful behaviors and beliefs. This perspective highlights their preference for restorative over retributive justice, positioning education and growth as central to addressing societal issues. Additionally, students uniquely emphasize how cancel culture’s normalization on social media platforms exacerbates mob mentality, creating an environment where collective outrage overshadows critical reflection. This focus on the dynamics of digital platforms adds nuance to their definitions, distinguishing them from broader societal understandings that may not fully account for the technological mechanisms fueling cancel culture. The Driving Factors of Cancel Culture Engagement. Marsh (2022) highlighted how cancel culture can stifle open discourse and freedom of speech on social media platforms, creating an environment where individuals fear public criticism or being “canceled.” Opinions varied regarding the motivations behind participating in cancel culture. Some participants attributed it to a desire for justice, particularly among the youth who seek to address societal injustices swiftly. Others criticized it as a shortcut that avoids the effort of educating others about offensive behaviors and promoting responsible citizenship. One participant noted: “It comes from a desire to simplify issues, rather than taking the long path of accountability and education.” Peer pressure was identified as a significant driver of cancel culture, with its widespread acceptance turning it into a societal norm and cultural phenomenon. Attribution theory provides insight into the diverse motivations for participating in cancel culture, as highlighted in Marsh’s (2022) work. Participants who perceive cancel culture as a form of justice, particularly among younger generations, tend to make dispositional attributions, connecting individuals’ behaviors to their internal morality and a desire to rectify societal injustices. This view sees canceling as an expedient way to address wrongs, often at the expense of more gradual processes like education and accountability. Critics, however, argue that this approach oversimplifies complex issues by emphasizing condemnation over understanding, leading to harsh judgments without considering situational influences. Such negative dispositional attributions can hinder meaningful dialogue and personal growth by prioritizing swift judgment over reflection and education. Additionally, peer pressure and social conformity play crucial roles in perpetuating cancel culture, as individuals may feel compelled to engage in canceling behavior due to social norms on platforms like social media, illustrating the significant impact of situational factors in shaping participation. Justifications for Cancellation. Wychunas (2021) stressed the importance of understanding the complexities surrounding how cancel culture is perceived, emphasizing the need for clear communication and public awareness to prevent unjust cancellations. Participants justified cancellation based on various criteria, including instances of harmful or irredeemable behavior, lack of remorse, and the need for accountability. One participant said: “”We’ve seen calls to action for people who have made offensive comments or engaged in illicit behavior. Sometimes it does work. They do change, and there is growth or a sense of making them face the consequences of their actions.” Canceling influential figures was deemed justified as a means to prevent their negative impact on others and hold them accountable for their actions based on said response. However, participants also criticized cancel culture as unfair in certain contexts. This included situations where criticism devolved into personal attacks, misinformation fueled cancellations, or entire communities suffered repercussions unfairly. Context and mitigating circumstances were seen as crucial factors in determining the fairness of cancellation, advocating for a nuanced approach that considers the severity of the offense and the proportionality of the response. This more nuanced reflection is seen reflected in another participant’s response: “Its effectiveness is often debated because, while there are cases where it serves its intended purpose, it also has the potential to encourage individuals to continue harmful behaviors secretly while avoiding public attention to escape consequences, which contradicts the whole idea of accountability.” Attribution Theory provides a useful framework for analyzing Wychunas’ (2021) discussion on cancel culture by differentiating between dispositional and situational attributions in understanding behavior. Participants in the discussion often make dispositional attributions when justifying the cancellation of influential figures based on harmful behavior, lack of remorse, or irredeemable actions, suggesting that such negative actions reflect the individual’s inherent character. However, criticism of cancel culture highlights the potential for unfairness, especially when cancellations devolve into personal attacks or are driven by misinformation, as these instances often

International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Publications (LJMRAP), Volume 1, Issue 1, pp. xx-xx, 2023. 13 Pages Posted: 1 Mar 2024 Far Eastern University Far Eastern University Far Eastern University Far Eastern University Far Eastern University,Manila, Philippines Date Written: December 2023 This study focused on the insights of college students on the social media landscape, specifically prevalent social media platforms, activities done on social media platforms, and frequency of cancel culture on social media platforms, as well as on cancel culture. A random sampling technique was used, which included 60 college students at Far Eastern University. This study utilized a non- experimental quantitative research design, specifically a descriptive one. Frequency, mean, and standard deviation The collegeâs insights on the prevalent social media landscape were discovered in research. It was found that Instagram was the most pervasive social media platform utilized. The collegeâs insights on the activities done on social media platforms and the frequency of cancellation culture on social media platforms were discovered in the research. The respondents agreed that their social media activities were about connecting with family and friends, engaging with other people's posts and tweets, expressing themselves freely, and keeping updated with current trends, news, and past events. Also, the respondents agreed that they often see cancellation culture on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube through posts and comment sections and sometimes on TikTok through comment sections and posts. The collegeâs insights on the cancellation culture were discovered in research. The respondents agreed that cancellation culture holds people responsible for their actions, impacts how people act in modern society and encourages people to reflect on their actions and address previous wrongdoings. The results show that cancel culture mainly occurs on social media platforms because of how progressive social media is nowadays.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cancel-culture-internet-joke-anything-but/,05-April-2021,"""Cancel culture"" seems to have started as an internet joke. Now it's anything but.","Watch CBS News Updated on: April 5, 2021 / 12:15 PM EDT / CBS News Watch the CBS Reports documentary, ""Speaking Frankly: Cancel Culture,"" in the video player above. Getting ""canceled"" frequently plays out the same way: A person — whether famous or not — says or does something controversial and the backlash on social media follows swiftly. Whether the public punishment corresponds to the act that sparked it may be up for debate, but the growing number of such incidents has fueled controversy over what's become known as ""cancel culture."" Critics of cancel culture say the process stifles free expression, inhibits the exchange of ideas and keeps people from straying from their comfort zones. Others, however, argue that it has empowered people to challenge the status quo and demand accountability from those in positions of power or wealth. The phenomenon we now know as cancel culture actually had innocuous beginnings before it morphed into a mechanism that can turn a person or a brand into a pariah in a matter of tweets. The term itself is vague and has become a catch-all for various situations with different degrees of severity and impact. Professor Anne H. Charity Hudley, an expert on African American culture and linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, broke down the idea into two distinct definitions. The first is essentially a boycott. ""It is the withdrawal of financial support, political support, social, economic support, often in pop culture in the form of attention of a particular media star, a political figure, a business figure,"" Hudley told CBS News. ""And withdrawing publicly your support in a way that informs other people that should withdraw their support as well."" ""The second definition, that is silencing something or somebody,"" she added. ""And they overlap, but it's a little bit different because one is more about withdrawing your attention and the other is actively seeking to stop someone else from speaking."" Depending on your view, she added, it can be perceived as the same thing. One of the earliest pop culture references to someone being ""canceled"" was in late 2014, during an episode of VH1's reality show ""Love and Hip-Hop: New York."" Cisco Rosado, a cast member and music executive, told his then-girlfriend Diamond Strawberry, ""You're canceled,"" after she revealed she had a daughter. The word took on a life of its own among mostly Black users on Twitter. It was used as a way to show disapproval for a person's actions as a joke or lighthearted criticism. Meg loves orange. She's cancelled 🙅 If we not on good terms by 11:59 your canceled Lisa Nakamura, the director of the Digital Studies Institute at the University of Michigan, told CBS News that because of the pandemic, ""canceling"" might be happening even more often these days, bringing wider attention to the phenomenon. ""Before, I don't think it was seen as a necessarily pervasive… it was just the internet being the internet,"" she said. ""But I really believe that post-COVID, everyone's on the internet so much that they're having to revise how important it is what you say online because no one's doing anything else."" Over the last few years, the term became more mainstream as prominent figures and brands became targets. But Meredith Clark, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia, told CBS News that getting — and remaining — canceled ""depends on who you are."" Clark said people who do not have ""access to power"" are the ones likely to face real consequences of cancel culture, while celebrities and people of wealth are often able to ride it out. ""They can buy their way out of the noise,"" she said. ""They could donate their way out of the noise. So, there are a number of different avenues that they have for protecting, upholding or defending their reputation, that poor folks, that working class folks, that even middle class folks don't have."" For example, Kevin Hart dropped out of hosting the 2019 Oscars after public outcry over his old homophobic tweets resurfaced. But after some time away from the spotlight, he continued performing stand-up and getting cast in movies. The popular food writer Alison Roman was the subject of online fury after making disparaging comments about Chrissy Teigen and Marie Kondo in an interview this spring, and the New York Times put her column on hiatus. After an apology and a period of social media silence, she re-emerged with a newsletter and is using her experience to try to educate others. This pattern of re-emergence after being ""canceled"" is not uncommon for people with certain levels of privilege. But for private citizens, a mistake caught on social media can follow them for years to come. In the CBS Reports documentary ""Speaking Frankly: Cancel Culture,"" a man named Adam Smith describes how his experience of being canceled cost him his job and even drove him to thoughts of suicide. Back in 2012, upset over Chick-fil-A's stance against gay marriage, Smith filmed a video of himself berating a Chick-fil-A employee at a drive-thru and posted it on YouTube. It went viral overnight and the backlash was fierce. His employer started receiving bomb and death threats and fired him. When other companies learned of the video, job offers disappeared. Smith was ""canceled"" before that terminology existed. In a viral incident from May 2020, a White woman named Amy Cooper was caught on camera calling the cops and making false accusations against Christian Cooper, a Black man who was birdwatching in Central Park. She lost her job in finance and even temporarily surrendered her dog to a shelter as the internet called out her actions as racist. Mr. Cooper later expressed reservations about the extent of the public vitriol directed at her. ""I don't know whether she's a racist or not,"" he told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King. ""I don't know her life. I don't know how she lives it. That act was unmistakably racist even if she didn't realize it in the moment."" ""I'm not sure someone's life should be defined by 60 seconds of poor judgment,"" he added. Cancel culture has taken on a political dimension, as well, as the tactic has been wielded in culture war debates on college campuses and beyond. Activists on the right, especially, have denounced it as a tool for enforcing political correctness and suppressing free speech. The political element came to the fore in the summer of 2020 when progressive activists targeted Goya Foods for a boycott after the company's CEO Robert Unanue praised President Donald Trump during a White House event. Unanue called the threat a ""suppression of speech."" Days later, Ivanka Trump posted a photo of herself holding a can of Goya beans in a show of support. ""Only the media and the cancel culture movement would criticize Ivanka for showing her personal support for a company that has been unfairly mocked, boycotted and ridiculed for supporting this administration,"" White House communications aide Caroline Hurley said. These examples are just a sampling of some of the vastly different scenarios that all fall under the umbrella of ""cancel culture."" And critics worry that responding to each perceived instance of wrongdoing with the same punishment — social outcasting — ignores important distinctions while still upholding a culture of privilege when it comes to who suffers lasting consequences. Clark told CBS News that canceling can serve a purpose when it gives underrepresented groups the ability to hold the powerful to account. To her, it should be about ""punching up."" ""I would say that cancel culture can be effective in terms of its ability to demonstrate the perspectives of people who otherwise don't have their voices heard or their perspectives recognized,"" Clark said. ""If you are not a person who has access to hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, if you're a person who doesn't have access to a major public platform... if you're not any of those people, then calling someone out via social media is one of the few tools that you have to hold them to account for any harm or damage that they may have done to you or people within your community,"" she continued. However, she does think it falls short of the goal many times. ""Too often, I do think that cancel culture gets into its own obsession with the purity of someone or an idea, that if an idea or a person doesn't completely align with a set of values, then they are essentially disposable,"" she said. Hudley also believes people need to be allowed to make mistakes, learn lessons and grow from the experience. ""If you made a mistake, we need to make a space for that,"" Hudley said. 'That's what I say to my friends who've been previously incarcerated, like you don't want to be judged on the one bad act. That's what people are nervous about."" Cydney Adams contributed.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/books/dr-seuss-books.html,04-March-2021,"Dr. Seuss Books Are Pulled, and a ‘Cancel Culture’ Controversy Erupts","What to Read Advertisement Supported by The beloved author’s most famous books, like “Green Eggs and Ham,” were untouched, but his estate’s decision nevertheless prompted a backlash and raised questions about what should be preserved as part of the cultural record. By Alexandra Alter and Elizabeth A. Harris In the summer of 1936, Theodor Geisel was on a ship from Europe to New York when he started scribbling silly rhymes on the ship’s stationery to entertain himself during a storm: “And this is a story that no one can beat. I saw it all happen on Mulberry Street.” The rhymes morphed into his first children’s book, “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,” about a boy who witnesses increasingly outlandish things. First published in 1937, the book started Geisel’s career as Dr. Seuss. He went on to publish more than 60 books that have sold some 700 million copies globally, making him one of the world’s most enduringly popular children’s book authors. But some aspects of Seuss’s work have not aged well, including his debut, which features a crude racial stereotype of an Asian man with slanted lines for eyes. “Mulberry Street” was one of six of his books that the Seuss estate said it would stop selling this week, after concluding that the egregious racial and ethnic stereotypes in the works “are hurtful and wrong.” The announcement seemed to drive a surge of support for Seuss classics. Dozens of his books shot to the top of Amazon’s print best-seller list; on Thursday morning, nine of the site’s top 10 best sellers were Seuss books. The estate’s decision — which prompted breathless headlines on cable news and complaints about “cancel culture” from prominent conservatives — represents a dramatic step to update and curate Seuss’s body of work, acknowledging and rejecting some of his views while seeking to protect his brand and appeal. It also raises questions about whether and how an author’s works should be posthumously curated to reflect evolving social attitudes, and what should be preserved as part of the cultural record. “It will cause people to re-evaluate the legacy of Dr. Seuss, and I think that’s a good thing,” said Philip Nel, a children’s literature scholar at Kansas State University and the author of “Dr. Seuss: American Icon.” “There are parts of his legacy one should honor, and parts of his legacy that one should not.” He added: “They may be motivated by the fact that racism is bad for the brand, or they may be motivated by a deeper sense of racial justice.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 16: Gina Carano attends the Premiere of Disney's ""Star Wars: The ... More Rise Of Skywalker"" on December 16, 2019 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/WireImage) On Tuesday, actress Gina Carano announced that Disney has removed all the press she did for season two of the hit Disney+ series The Mandalorian after she refused to apologize for comments she posted on social media. Carano, who had played the breakout character Cara Dune and who was almost as popular as ""Baby Yoda,"" was released from the series earlier this month. Lucasfilm, which is the production house behind the series, said in a statement Carano was no longer employed by the company and would not be seen in upcoming seasons of The Mandalorian or other projects in the future. Because she had refused to apologize, Lucasfilm has pulled the press she did for the series. The former MMA fighter and model has been largely unapologetic for comments she has made across social media regarding her belief that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, as well as her stance on the wearing of masks during the Covid-19 pandemic. For months there had been a strong movement on social media that called for Carano's firing, and it was last week that Lucasfilm and its parent company Disney finally responded. It isn't just her appearance in press events that is being deleted from history, toy giant Hasbro announced that it has scrapped plans to make any further Cara Dune action figures. Retailers have had to cancel preorders of the latest figures, which had reportedly been quite high. ""The 'Star Wars' Black [Series] Cara Dune figure was released in 2020 and sold out not long after the inventory was received,"" a spokeswoman for BigBadToyStore told The Hollywood Reporter in a Monday email. ""Hasbro planned for another production run and we were accepting preorders from that production run. Due to recent events, Hasbro was no longer approved to produce any more of this figure."" While the first run of figures will likely soon become collector's items, due to the backlash on social media it appears that some retailers seemed eager to sell existing stock faster than a jump to light speed. Retail giant Walmart had Cara Dune figures with accessories discounted to just $2 from a list price of $19.87 on Tuesday afternoon. Reaction From Fans And Supporters Since Carano was fired, there has been a steady stream of supporters. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was among those who defended the actress's right to free speech and personal opinions, while UFC President Dana White also issued his support. Many of her fans have continued to stand behind her, and a Change.org petition was even started that called for her to be rehired. The petition, ""Disney: Rehire Gina Carano"" had more than 43,000 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon, just shy of its goal to get 50,000. Logan Norfleet, who started the petition, wrote ""I'm not going to say she was right or wrong with her views, but firing celebrities over their political views has been happening way too often, and once again, Hollywood has struck down another conservative. What she said may have been a little extreme, and I can even see why some people may have been offended, but her tweet was not made to incite violence or to express discrimination or hatred of any sort to any particular group."" The actress has been largely quiet on social media since her firing, but many have still used Twitter and other platforms to show support. A few have continued to call her out, however. Among those was the official account from struggling video game retailer GameStop (@GameStop), which tweeted, ""Opinion: Save the First Amendment pearl clutching.

https://www.thewrap.com/coming-back-from-cancel-culture-means-self-reflection-experts-say-the-twitter-mob-is-us/,16-June-2021,"Coming Back From Cancel Culture Means Self-Reflection, Experts Say: ‘The Twitter Mob is Us’","The group that’s doing the canceling has an equally important role in someone becoming “uncanceled,” PR professionals argue in final panel of TheWrap series How does one go from being “canceled” to returning to the public square, or even just your neighborhood coffeehouse? For that to happen, not only does the canceled person need to reflect on their actions – but so does the group that’s doing the canceling: the social media mob. “We talk about the Twitter mob as if it’s not us,” Joan Ball, a marketing professor at St. John’s University who also consults social influencers said during TheWrap’s final “Conversations on Cancel Culture” roundtable. “But the Twitter mob is us. Right? Every retweet. Any ‘Can you believe that this happened?’ And so it may not be us in one circumstance, but it’s us in another circumstance.” The path to reconciliation in the current cancel culture environment was the central topic debated by Ball and other panelists — communications professor Gabrielle Gambrell (New York University), crisis PR manager Matthew Hiltzik (Hiltzik Strategies) and pop culture expert Dax Holt (Hollywood Raw podcast) — during the “Coming Back From Being Canceled: Is There a Way?” panel moderated by TheWrap’s Deputy Editor Lawrence Yee. Ball continued: “What does it mean to just be a citizen in social? And how do we operate as citizens in social? And what is it that people get from spending a day retweeting things, and being in community with one another, as they are canceling?” (new Image()).src = 'https://capi.connatix.com/tr/si?token=04c48d04-c977-4eb4-b4e2-22521fec8e72&cid=8759484e-bb96-415e-9d33-167af5d155f0'; cnx.cmd.push(function() { cnx({ playerId: ""04c48d04-c977-4eb4-b4e2-22521fec8e72"" , mediaId: ""45d8654b-84bf-4738-beb3-5c0632f124a9"" }).render(""7ceb9f9117a34a9d8af689a8d459e5a3""); }); The discussion looked at cases of celebrities who had been dropped from “canceled” — figuratively and literally from their shows — after what was deemed bad behavior. Gambrell was part of the CBS Entertainment communications team in early 2011 when their top sitcom “Two and a Half Men” went on hiatus to accommodate star Charlie Sheen’s rehab. Sheen later badmouthed show creator Chuck Lorre as a “maggot” and “loser,” leading the season to be canceled and Sheen’s dismissal. Around the same time, Sheen’s children with then-wife Brooke Mueller were removed from his home (He was previously arrested in late 2009 for assaulting her). “That was a huge opportunity for some people to say, ‘Hey, what’s going on?’ Gambrell recalled. “Is there a mental health issue going on? Is there something personal going on? And then other people were perhaps on the cancel train, [saying] ‘He perhaps does not deserve to have this illustrious position, his high paid profile position on the show.” (new Image()).src = 'https://capi.connatix.com/tr/si?token=04c48d04-c977-4eb4-b4e2-22521fec8e72&cid=8759484e-bb96-415e-9d33-167af5d155f0'; cnx.cmd.push(function() { cnx({ playerId: ""04c48d04-c977-4eb4-b4e2-22521fec8e72"" , mediaId: ""a20d658d-4749-42b5-bb0a-4747b4964f88"" }).render(""b2b5e5d081734082ab2a2c60aad382da""); }); Sheen’s behavior continued to spiral; despite public declarations of “winning,” he continued to struggle with substance abuse, martial woes, prostitutes and employment. More than four years after after he was fired from the show, Sheen disclosed his HIV-positive status on “Today.” “‘Here’s what I’ve been going through, here’s what I’ve been dealing with. And I own my truth,’” Gambrell paraphrased. “And I do think that was phenomenal for him. And very courageous of him to do that interview on ‘The Today Show and own his truth.’ Of course, self-reflection and owning one’s truth takes time — often with the help of crisis managers. Social media may demand an immediate reaction, but that may only make things worse. “You don’t want to just win the moment, you want to make sure that you’re being responsible over a longer-term period,” said Hiltzik, who has worked with athletes and celebrities on rehabilitating their image after a public gaffe. “In general, I prefer to take a more deliberate approach because I think one thing that is needed in the moment, the passion is there, the intensity of the responses on social and digital are way stronger than they are if you let it dissipate a little bit. And very often, if you understand sort of what cards you have to play, if you play them too quickly, they’re not gonna necessarily be that effective, because a lot of time no one wants to hear it.” (new Image()).src = 'https://capi.connatix.com/tr/si?token=04c48d04-c977-4eb4-b4e2-22521fec8e72&cid=8759484e-bb96-415e-9d33-167af5d155f0'; cnx.cmd.push(function() { cnx({ playerId: ""04c48d04-c977-4eb4-b4e2-22521fec8e72"" , mediaId: ""414af628-39a9-4bcf-b506-17c109067767"" }).render(""ec205e26c9cb434d83aab5041f58a5c9""); }); Holt saw this play out with one of his podcast guests, Kristen Doute. Doute had been fired from the reality show “Vanderpump Rules” after reporting a Black castmate to police for a crime she did not commit. Doute appeared on Holt’s “Hollywood Raw” podcast after a time of self-reflection. “We said, ‘Okay, come on the podcast, and let’s talk about it. Let’s talk about the conversations that you’ve been having what you’ve actually learned, and have you learned anything,’” Holt explained. “And it was a really great conversation to the point where I noticed a shift in, in the dynamics. So once we released it, and people started listening to it, hearing the full interview, people going, ‘Okay, I hear that she has learned and whether some of her answers may have been thought out, either way, they could hear the genuine feelings behind it.” (new Image()).src = 'https://capi.connatix.com/tr/si?token=04c48d04-c977-4eb4-b4e2-22521fec8e72&cid=8759484e-bb96-415e-9d33-167af5d155f0'; cnx.cmd.push(function() { cnx({ playerId: ""04c48d04-c977-4eb4-b4e2-22521fec8e72"" , mediaId: ""8dbeee16-c5dd-4835-b154-b6949b591e07"" }).render(""d1fb001f362f4c1a88d1240f9cc10cd1""); }); In the end, the panel agreed that individuals non-criminal transgressions should get the chance to take accountability for their actions and redeem themselves, or as Yee put it, be afforded “grace and space.” Check out the full roundtable discussion about coming back from being canceled above.

Or wearing a mask with the word “CENSORED” on it while you deliver fully uncensored remarks to millions of broadcast television viewers. This is how Marjorie Taylor Greene—the first lady of political thea-tuh who tweeted about suffering the “slings and arrows” of a “vicious cancel culture mob”—has spent her time in office so far.

(Rhetorically, “political correctness” is its more direct predecessor, but then Black Twitter invented the term “cancel” and white conservatives decided that, like everything else, they just had to have it.) The current ubiquity of the phrase belies its central thesis, since all the airtime and column space conservatives are given to talk about cancellation proves they were never cancelled in the first place. Ted Cruz claimed at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference that liberals have canceled stand-up comedy, and “Judge” Jeanine Pirro called the shutdown of white supremacist safe-space Parler a “censorship that is akin to a Kristallnacht.” The theme of this year’s CPAC, by the way, was “America Uncanceled” (though even organizers canceled one of their speakers), and the Republican National Committee last summer actually issued a resolution that stated: “Freedom of speech is trampled on daily with the notions of ‘political correctness,’ the plan to eliminate so-called ‘hate speech,’ and the promotion of a ‘cancel culture,’ which has grown into erasing of history, encouraging lawlessness, muting citizens, and violating free exchange of ideas, thoughts, and speech.” Republican Senator Josh Hawley claimed his loss of a book deal because he voted to overturn a democratic election and helped incite a treasonous insurrection was an assault on his First Amendment rights, writing, “I will fight this cancel culture with everything I have. We’ll see you in court.” (Hawley got a new publisher roughly two weeks later and hasn’t mentioned the lawsuit since.) Jim Jordan, another House GOP “Stop the Steal” booster, called cancel culture—not Covid, escalating white-supremacist terror, or sexual abuse of college athletes during his time as a campus coach—the “most dangerous” issue in the country, and cited Donald Trump’s being kicked off Twitter for inciting the Capitol insurrection as proof that cancellation will cause “long-term consequences to our democracy.” Popular ""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe → The Careerism That Enabled Biden’s Reelection Run Still Poisons the Democratic Party The Careerism That Enabled Biden’s Reelection Run Still Poisons the Democratic Party Norman Solomon The Biden Scandal Goes Well Beyond the Aging Cover-Up The Biden Scandal Goes Well Beyond the Aging Cover-Up Jeet Heer The Real Reason Those White South Africans Are Here The Real Reason Those White South Africans Are Here Kali Holloway Is Donald Trump About to Launch a Denaturalization Purge?

It’s also a perfect illustration of the bait-and-switch tactic underlying all the phony Republican hysteria fueling so-called cancel culture. Conservatives’ indignation is really just anger over the fact that marginalized folks—mostly thanks to social media—can now call them out for all the things they regularly say and do to further racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic agendas and white mob violence. What these put-upon conservatives are really pissed about isn’t censorship or cancellation. It’s consequences.

When they were the ones doing all the canceling, the right wing was actually fervently pro-cancellation. It’s not just the fundamental lie of “cancel culture” that’s so irritating, it’s the staggering hypocrisy of those who can’t stop, won’t stop whining about it. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, in a tizzy over the discontinuation by the estate of Dr. Seuss of six lesser-known books with racist content, had the audacity to gripe via social media that “the woke mob” is trying “to erase our history and cancel anyone who disagrees.” This is the same Tom Cotton who wrote a whole legislative act aimed at banning schools from teaching the 1619 Project, the initiative exploring how the United States was indelibly shaped by slavery—or what Cotton blithely describes as “the necessary evil upon which the union was built.” Cotton is not concerned about the censoring of history; he’s just picky about what parts of history get erased. What the Arkansas senator really means when he gets prickly about preserving “our history” is making sure the mythical white-supremacist recollection of American events is the only version schoolkids can read. Along with racist Dr. Seuss books, of course. There is an historic thread tying right-wingers who today call everything left of them communism, who label anti-racist and social justice movements like BLM terrorism, and the anti–civil rights racists and red-baiting McCarthyite “traditionalists” of yesteryear. You want to know who was actually canceled by these sorts? Abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, who was ordered by a court to stop printing his abolitionist newspaper The True American, had all his printing machines stolen by an angry racist mob, and was twice the target of attempted assassinations. Callie House, mother of five and a formerly enslaved woman who fought for reparations for emancipated black folks, who was railroaded on phony mail fraud charges in 1917 and served a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Labor leader and Socialist Party Chair Eugene Debs, who spent more than two years in jail for a 1918 anti-war speech.

Racism and red-scare hysteria also canceled the acting career of Canada Lee, who was blacklisted from movies and died broke in 1952 at the age of 45. The song “Mississippi Goddam” got Nina Simone banned from the radio and much of the American South, and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics essentially hounded Billie Holiday to death for the sin of stubbornly refusing to stop performing the anti-lyching song “Strange Fruit.” But really, we don’t even have to look that far back in time for examples of right-wing cancellation. All these self-deputized anti–“cancel culture” cops were, just a few years ago, openly in favor of canceling NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who kneeled—instead of sitting, on the advice of a former Green Beret—during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black folks. When right-wingers attempted to paint Kaepernick’s protest as an un-American insult to the military, he reiterated his respect for the “men and women [who] have fought for this country,” and underscored the need for America to stand by the principles it claims to send citizens to wage wars over. “They fight for freedom. They fight for the people. They fight for liberty and justice for everyone,” Kaepernick said way back in August 2016, just days after his first silent protest. “That’s not happening. People are dying in vain because this country isn’t holding their end of the bargain up, as far as giving freedom and justice, liberty to everybody.” What’s more traditionally American than black folks’ peacefully protesting as a way to demand that this country actually fulfill its promise of “freedom and justice, liberty to everybody”? In response, the people who now won’t shut up about being shut down —those who Debs, in the speech that got him jailed, rightly described as those “wrapped up in the American flag, who shout their claim from the housetops that they are the only patriots, and who have their magnifying glasses in hand, scanning the country for evidence of disloyalty”—were very keen on canceling Kaepernick for exercising the First Amendment rights they now claim to cherish. That group was led by Trump, who pushed hard to have Kaepernick fired. In a now infamous 2017 speech, the then-president targeted “NFL owners”—an overwhelmingly Republican collective of billionaires—and essentially demanded that when a player knelt in protest, they should throw “that son of a bitch off the field right now.” The NFL kowtowed to Trump, decreeing that players who did not stand during the anthem would be fined. Not quite satisfied, Trump doubled down on his cancellation demands, saying, “You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there, maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.” Two years after getting Kaepernick and NFL safety Eric Reid effectively blackballed from their careers for exercising their constitutional rights, Trump claimed that “cancel culture, driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees,” is “the very definition of totalitarianism.” Marjorie Taylor Greene applauded Trump’s condemnations, posting social media messages alternately demanding “NO KNEELING” and thanking Trump “for pushing” the kneeling issue. The website Law Enforcement Today quoted her describing Kaepernick as a “destructive vocal influencer.” (Notably, when one of Greene’s conservative allies complained of censorship, Greene did a 180, tweeting, “You shouldn’t have to stop speaking the truth and posting about your political beliefs in order to continue your work…. And you are guaranteed free speech by the 1A!”) Cruz told his followers they should cancel rich spoiled athletes who “dishonor our flag” by committing to “never buy another shoe, shirt, or jersey.” Pirro called NFL protests for social justice “crap” and when Kaepernick sued the NFL for collusion, went on TV to loudly shout that Kaepernick didn’t “have a right to be in the NFL.” Yes, the woman who compared Trump’s Twitter ban to a Nazi pogrom against the Jews had the gall to demean Kaepernick as “a crybaby.” freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: ""thenation_article_indent"", slotId: ""thenation_article_indent"", targeting:{ tn_author: ['kali-h'], tn_articleid: [380674], tn_ptype: 'article', tn_keyword: [false], tn_subject: ['labor', 'labor-orga', 'media', 'politics', 'racism-and', 'republican', 'society', 'the-right', 'working-co'], tn_pos: 'rectangle_4', tn_loc:'atf' } }); Those calls to cancel Kaepernick, juxtaposed against the bogus concerns about “cancel culture” now coming from the same quarters, prove what was always painfully obvious: White conservatives don’t want free speech; they want to speak hate without repercussions. The most salient American conservative value is cultural dominance, and these people resent the cultural shifts they perceive as threatening that dominance. For so long, they took pleasure in canceling folks for challenging their power, punishing dissenters by ruining reputations, careers and lives. Now, they’ve seized upon the word “cancel” to describe the comparatively mild discomfort of being held vaguely accountable by the people they believe should shut up, and put up with the pain they actively seek to cause. The anti–“cancel culture” movement runs on resentment and fear—of the democratization of social authority and influence, which they believe whittles away at their position as the arbiters of morality, justice, and freedom—virtues they have always defined in transparently narrow, self-serving terms. I’m not sure I’ve seen a better encapsulation of what cancel culture is about than just after the white-supremacist Capitol coup attempt, when The Nation contributor Andrew McCormick described one participant’s rage over facing consequences she obviously regarded as meant for other people. “This is not America,” a woman said to a small group, her voice shaking. She was crying, hysterical. “They’re shooting at us. They’re supposed to shoot BLM, but they’re shooting the patriots.” The sad part is, their powers almost fully remain intact. They’re just too greedy to recognize it. Consequently, we get Tomi Lahren— the right-wing bullhorn whose entire career is such an unendingly tired and badly argued hot take about Kaepernick that she should have to pay him royalties and residuals from every paycheck—having the unmitigated nerve to call cancel culture “deadly and unAmerican.” Lahren has spent the last several months calling for conservatives to use cancel culture to cancel cancel culture, a plan demonstrating a stunning lack of vision or originality. What she means is that the right should keep perfecting the very thing they invented. Even as they complain of being victimized by it.

https://animexnews.com/mrbeasts-involved-in-serious-allegations/,07-September-2024,"MrBeast’s Organization involved in Serious Allegations: Misconduct, Fraud, and Abuse Claims","Home » Celebrities By AxN Desk In a recent video, serious allegations have surfaced against key figures associated with the popular YouTuber MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson. The video delves into claims of misconduct, including s*xual assault, domestic violence, and involvement in fraudulent schemes. This article will summarize the key points from the video, highlighting the gravity of these allegations and the need for public awareness. The video primarily focuses on James Warren, alleged to be the secret CEO of MrBeast’s company. Warren is accused of a history of aggressive behavior and domestic violence, with multiple sources corroborating these claims. The narrator emphasizes that Warren’s behavior has been described by some as that of a “psychopath” who screams at people and hits his girlfriends. A significant concern raised in the video is the deletion of evidence related to these allegations. This raises questions about accountability and the extent to which MrBeast’s team is involved in covering up these incidents. The creator of the video plans to highlight inconsistencies in MrBeast’s responses to these allegations, suggesting a broader cover-up. James Warren is also implicated in promoting a fraudulent real estate scheme led by Joshua Hutchins. This scheme resulted in significant financial losses for victims, casting doubt on Warren’s ethical responsibility and accountability in real estate practices. The video explains how Ponzi schemes operate and the inherent risks involved, serving as a cautionary tale for potential investors. Victims of the real estate scheme, such as Sylvia, have shared their deep emotional and financial distress. Their experiences underscore the real-world consequences of such fraudulent activities, emphasizing the need for better investor protection. The video highlights the complexity of investigating these claims due to common names in North Carolina, making it challenging to gather concrete evidence. Lacoa Hill, another key figure in MrBeast’s organization, is accused of s*xual misconduct. Despite previous incidents, Hill was rehired and later let go again. Multiple employees reported his inappropriate behavior, including s*xual harassment and creating uncomfortable situations on set. The company’s decision to rehire him despite these allegations raises serious concerns about accountability and workplace culture. Former employees describe a toxic work environment at MrBeast’s company, characterized by inappropriate comments and behavior. Female employees felt unsafe and uncomfortable, citing specific examples of harassment and misogynistic attitudes prevalent among male coworkers. Allegations of cover-ups regarding serious accusations, including s*xual misconduct, have emerged, raising questions about the company’s internal investigation processes and accountability. Allegations of misogyny and inappropriate behavior have also surfaced against Jimmy Donaldson himself. Several women have come forward with claims of s*xual misconduct, indicating a systemic problem within the company. Maddy Spadel’s recent Instagram post hints at her past experiences with Jimmy, suggesting a pattern of behavior that has deeply affected her. The video underscores the importance of credible sources and ongoing investigations into these claims. The creator relies on assistance from other YouTube personalities who are submitting Freedom of Information requests to gather more information on the allegations against Warren. This collective effort aims to expose these issues for public awareness and to hold MrBeast and his associates accountable. The allegations against MrBeast’s associates are serious and warrant thorough investigation. The video highlights a troubling pattern of behavior that includes s*xual assault, domestic violence, and involvement in fraudulent schemes. These claims not only reflect poorly on the individuals involved but also raise significant concerns about the workplace culture and accountability within MrBeast’s organization.

Credit: In July 2010, former Georgia State Director of Rural Development for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Shirley Sherrod was abruptly and unceremoniously fired after a highly-edited video of portions of a speech she gave at a NAACP event began circulating on conservative media. The July 20 CBS News article “Shirley Sherrod: White House Forced My Resignation” reported her reflections about two calls she received from USDA deputy undersecretary Cheryl Cook while driving. ""The last time they asked me to pull over the side of the road and submit my resignation on my Blackberry, and that's what I did,"" explained Sherrod. The next day, CBS News continued the story with an article entitled, “Vilsack: I Will Have to Live with Shirley Sherrod Mistake.” By then, President Obama’s Agriculture Secretary who’d made the decision to terminate her learned of the full video and the context that showed her speech was actually denouncing racial bias. Vilsack (and The White House) apologized to Sherrod admitting that the decision was made hastily, Vilsack adding “I did not think before I acted and for that reason, this poor woman has gone through a very difficult time."" While Sherrod was ultimately offered a different position at the USDA, her reputation was clearly sullied in the most public of spectacles. Tom Vilsack on the other hand was not terminated for his clear and consequential lapse in judgment, and instead years later was named Secretary of the USDA earlier this year by the Biden administration. While Sherrod’s firing is arguably one of the most egregious and public examples of someone being terminated prematurely and wrongly, there was little if any whining about “cancel culture” then as the term hadn’t become common vernacular yet. Indeed, “cancel culture” has become the persistent refrain for high-profile “cancellations” over the past couple years, but people have been wrongly or prematurely “cancelled” for decades (if not longer) which begs the question….Why is “cancel culture” such a common refrain now? Maybe the difference isn’t the prevalence of the cancellations as much as it is who is getting cancelled? Perhaps the truth is that Black and Brown people have historically been granted very little (if any) margin of error much less second, third and fourth chances, and in the midst of the country’s racial reckoning, high-profile, mostly White celebrities, executives and other leaders are now being treated more like everyone else? Maybe it’s yet another example of the saying, “When those with privilege are faced with equality, to them it often feels like oppression.” The truth is that while many high-profile (usually) White people are disgusted by this new “one significant strike and you’re out” culture, many Black and Brown people are thinking “Welcome to the party” while even more are wondering how they can even attain these high-profile positions in the first place. Certainly, no one wants to feel like they work in a perfectionist environment where any single misstep or minor slip of the tongue could spell termination, but is that a fair assessment of what’s really happening? That’s highly debatable. Yes, we have to create a space for people to make mistakes, have a bad day or just get it wrong occasionally. Let’s face it—if we were all judged by our worst moment, we’d likely be unemployed (or worse). But on the other hand, much of what seems to be increasingly labeled as “cancel culture” may just be long overdue accountability for the elite and powerful who have grown accustomed to the tacit immunity that often accompanies wealth, power and celebrity. For people of color and other marginalized communities, our “cancel culture” was always in effect only then, the powers that be labeled it “consequences.” I can’t help but think that now—in the age of ubiquitous video camers and lighting fast social media—those consequences have crept into the ivory towers of those unaccustomed to them, and they’ve been received as an invasion. Diversity, equity and inclusion practitioner Farzin Farzad insists, “Cancel culture is a relatively new term developed to insulate the powerful from being held accountable for hateful language. It is a mere propaganda tool that has proliferated in our mainstream discourse.” Anti-racism educator and author of Blaxhaustion: Karens & Other Threats to Black Lives and Well-Being Theresa M. Robinson also points out the subjectivity of what gets labeled “cancel culture”… and what doesn’t. “Cancel culture is either unfair or justified based on the recipient and the alleged ‘transgression,’” insists Robinson. “Colin Kaepernick is one of the best examples of how the cancel culture double-standard operates. He is just one in a long line of Black folks who’ve been subject to ‘canceling’ at the hands of a system that systemically marginalizes and oppresses others.” For those who may be quick to defend a politician compelled to resign after the publication of an incriminating video or a company executive resigning after being caught on a hot mike yelling racial slurs, let’s consider the following. Actions have consequences and some infractions are indeed cancel worthy. Sometimes once is enough. It’s just that simple. Just as there are no mulligans for teachers who molest children or airline pilots who drink and fly, there are some decisions, actions and behaviors that should require immediate separation from the organization, and that separation isn’t necessarily the worst that could happen to them. For some, it actually might be the wake up call that helps them get it together and grow professionally. When it comes to issues of equity and inclusion, many advocates consider zero tolerance policies an important part of rooting out racism, bias and broader discrimination. “Freedom of speech or freedom to act doesn’t imply freedom from consequences,” insists anti-racism educator and consultant Denise Branch. “’Consequence culture’ is needed to build safer, more inclusive, equitable and accountable workplaces.” We should expect more of our leaders, media personalities and government officials. Why is it that Brad the CEO who gets caught misusing company information or participating in inappropriate relationships often departs with a lucrative payout and a carefully worded public relations stement about his desire to spend more time with family, but Jerome the mail clerk who may have padded an expese report once or twice is not just terminated and persecuted, but possibly prosecuted? Certainly, all the behaviors are wrong, but too often it seems that we excuse so much more from those at the top of the food chain but are ready to pounce on less serious infractions from those at the bottom. Arguably, our system of “workplace justice” is often anything but just. The high profile incident may very well have been just one in a pattern. The truth is that while it may seem like someone was terminated, forced to resign or otherwise cancelled immediately after one particularly public incident, it may very well have been one incident of many—particularly if they exhibited extreme behavior. Consider situations like those where a politician is caught hurling a racial slur on a hot microphone, or a senior executive’s leaked emails are found to be riddled with offensive homophobic references. While it’s certainly possible that those incidents were completely out of character for them (and the first of their kind), arguably they’re more likely a reflection of simply who they are when no one is looking. After all, if a 60 year old gets caught speeding 90+ mph on the highway, it’s most likely not the first time she’s sped. Remember that personnel issues are typically confidential so while someone may have had a very public incident that resulted in dismissal, that may have actually been one in a string of previous incidents that were not publicly known. Certainly, the ubiquity of cameras and a 24/7 news cycle has made it exponentially easier to get caught doing something stupid or worse, and that’s placed a brighter spotlight on those in high-profile positions, but isn’t that a feature, not a bug of our more technologically advanced society? Shouldn’t we expect people in these esteemed positions to actually live up to the supposed merits that got them there or do we treat those in high-profile positions as if they’re untouchable atop the corporate caste system and not subject to the same consequences as mere underlings—even though role modeling is arguably part of a leader’s job? Let’s be clear—having anyone be wrongly or prematurely terminated or otherwise “cancelled” is obviously a horrible, unfortunate injustice. It was wrong when it happened to Shirley Sherrod, and it’s wrong now, but it’s not necessarily “cancel culture.” It may just be good, old-fashioned poor management. But when high-profile leaders and personalities are denounced, fired or pressured to step down after bad behavior, we could just be witnessing swift, direct consequences. The accusation “cancel culture” seems to suggest that some outside force or societal aberration is actually to blame when the truth may be that it just feels overly harsh and shocking to those used to doling out consequences, not experiencing them.",bydana brownle bydana brownle contributor credit juli georgia director rural develop unit depart agricultur usda shirlei sherrod abruptli unceremoni fire highli edit video portion speech naacp event circul conserv medium juli cb new articl shirlei sherro tongu stick white hous forc resign report reflect call receiv usda deputi undersecretari cheryl cook drive time pull road submit resign blackberri tongu stick lain sherrod dai cb new continu stori articl entitl vilsack live shirlei sherrod mistak presid obama agricultur secretari decis termin learn video context speech denounc racial bia vilsack white hous apolog sherrod admit decis hastili vilsack add act reason poor woman difficult time sherrod ultim offer posit usda reput sulli public spectacl tom vilsack hand termin consequenti laps judgment name secretari usda earli biden administr sherrod fire arguabl egregi public exampl termin prematur wrongli whine cancel cultur term hadn common vernacular cancel cultur persist refrain profil cancel past coupl peopl wrongli prematur cancel decad beg question cancel cultur common refrain differ isn preval cancel cancel truth black brown peopl histor grant margin error 4 chanc midst countri racial reckon profil white celebr execut leader treat privileg face equal feel oppress truth profil white peopl disgust signific strike cultur black brown peopl think parti wonder attain profil posit feel perfectionist environ singl misstep minor slip tongu spell termin fair assess happen highli debat creat space peopl mistak bad dai wrong occasion judg bad moment unemploi bad hand increasingli label cancel cultur overdu account elit power grow accustom tacit immun accompani wealth power celebr peopl color margin commun cancel cultur effect power label consequ ag ubiquit video camer light fast social medium consequ creep ivori tower unaccustom receiv invas divers equiti inclus practition farzin farzad insist cancel cultur term develop insul power hold account hate languag mere propaganda tool prolifer mainstream discours anti racism educ author blaxhaust karen threat black life theresa robinson subject label cancel cultur doesn cancel cultur unfair justifi base recipi alleg transgress insist robinson colin kaepernick exampl cancel cultur doubl standard oper line black folk subject cancel hand system system margin oppress quick defend politician compel resign public incrimin video compani execut resign catch hot mike yell racial slur action consequ infract cancel worthi simpl mulligan teacher molest child airlin pilot drink fly decis action behavior requir separ organ separ isn necessarili bad happen wake call help grow profession issu equiti inclus advoc toler polici root racism bia broad discrimin freedom speech freedom act doesn impli freedom consequ insist anti racism educ consult denis branch consequ cultur build safe inclus equit account workplac tongu stick ect leader medium person govern offici brad ceo catch misus compani inform particip inappropri relationship depart lucr payout carefulli word public relat stement desir spend time famili jerom mail clerk pad tongu stick es report termin persecut possibli prosecut behavior wrong excus top food chain readi pounc infract bottom arguabl system workplac justic profil incid pattern truth termin forc resign cancel immedi public incid incid exhibit extrem behavior situat politician catch hurl racial slur hot microphon senior execut leak email find riddl offens homophob refer incid complet charact arguabl reflect simpli catch speed mph highwai time speed rememb personnel issu typic confidenti public incid result dismiss string previou incid publicli ubiqu camera new cycl tongu stick onenti easi catch stupid bad bright spotlight profil posit isn featur bug technolog advanc societi shouldn tongu stick ect peopl esteem posit live suppos merit treat profil posit untouch atop corpor cast system subject consequ mere underl role model arguabl leader job wrongli prematur termin cancel horribl unfortun injustic wrong happen shirlei sherrod wrong necessarili cancel cultur fashion poor manag profil leader person denounc fire pressur step bad behavior wit swift direct consequ accus cancel cultur suggest forc societ aberr blame truth feel overli harsh shock dole consequ tongu stick erienc,42,2,0.15484956869345676,0.4523458868083316,0.12097622554176309,0.05322953923837577,0.026719966337050285,0.0856301283399958,0.10624868504102672,42,Celebrity Culture & Brand Boycotts
https://daily.jstor.org/cancel-culture-is-chaotic-good/,18-December-2019,Cancel Culture Is Chaotic Good,"Cancel culture may prove to be the most memorable linguistic trend of the past decade. As the year draws to a close, it’s hard to believe it’s also the end of a very strange and tumultuous decade. Who knows what the next ten years will bring? All signs point to a continuation of the same roller coaster ride of social, political, and environmental upheaval, except we’ll probably have to get used to endless puns about hindsight being 2020. It’s a good thing a nice cosy chat about language is kind of the Snuggie of polite, anxiety-free conversation we need these days. What did happen to language during the awkward teen years of the millennium? So many things! Most obviously, we could point to many emerging slang terms from the last ten years that left an impression, if the numerous hot takes by media commentators are anything to go by, from bae to YOLO to everything else that was on fleek and had everyone shook etc., etc. But while a lot of slang terms might be fire now (and not necessarily the dumpster kind), there’s no telling whether they have any staying power. Will “lit” become the 1870s “nanty narking” of the 2010s or “extra” the new “enthuzimuzzy?” As the novel impact of these terms become diluted, especially by those who are fellow-kids-ing their hearts out, they fall out of fashion, becoming less effective as a way to show where you belong. This is nothing really new, but looking deeper, how much do these slang terms really represent what went on in the last ten years? Although the internet has been around for a while (people often forget that the web, a virtual millennial at 25, is not the same thing as the internet, born in 1969, which would totally be Gen X if it cared, which, whatever), it’s really in this decade that internet language came into its own. There was a definite linguistic growth spurt from the real native speakers of the online world coming of age, building on successive waves of internet language. The ways we convey information now, not just through text but internet memes, emojis, gifs, short form video, and the language and meta-language we use to reference these new forms of creative communication, have all influenced mainstream language in fascinating ways. The hashtag, for example, birthed around 2007, soon became a commonplace but powerful element of online communication that not only linked information from different sources, it encapsulated what a spontaneous online community was centered around. Hashtags added nuance and meta-commentary to what was said. But our ways of speaking have been racing ahead faster than many of us can keep up with. While language change is not a new thing, thanks to the wide-ranging network of social media, it’s different in how fast and how virally it can spread now, as well as the impact it can have on real life, as speakers take up the linguistic trends used in their groups. Gender neutral “they,” for example, has been a thing for hundreds of years, yet today, it’s far more widespread and accepted, becoming Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s word of the year. What’s really remarkable is not just the random slang that comes and goes, but those neologisms that arose out of a desperate need, like gender neutral pronouns, that spoke to the real and urgent issues arising in society that demand a public debate and a way to talk about them. When we begin to reassess our identities, we also question where we belong and what we believe, together as a group. It’s terms like #MeToo and “woke” and even “fake news” that have resonance in today’s world, as a kind of call to arms, in a way that “on fleek” does not. These terms seek to open up to debate the things that were once blindly accepted and taken for granted. It’s these terms that may outlast the ephemeral slang cycle, and it’s these terms that reveal this decade’s remarkable preoccupation with self, community, belonging, beliefs, and the language that goes hand in hand with building these ties. Often we talk about language in innocent, superficial ways, as though new ways of communicating are exactly as they appear. This simplistic idea of language as, say, listicles of intriguing new slang conceals the fact that, in our post-truth world, language has become more overtly dangerous, and this can be both bad or good. Language has always been effectively used in propaganda or advertising to persuade masses of people, only now we have a better understanding of how it does this, as it’s become much easier, through social media, to use language as an effective weapon, a means of amplifying information of all kinds, by pretty much anyone who wants to (theoretically). And when you have masses of people not legally sanctioned to criticize social behaviors, this can be a concern to some. Judging from panic-stricken media commentary, sometimes it seems as though the one thing more frightening than a lone gunman (and it isn’t a young person responding to your well-intentioned life advice with “ok boomer”) is a random bunch of people who have banded together in some common cause. When this common cause is being aggrieved against someone’s problematic behavior, and results in “calling out,” silencing or boycotting the problematic behavior, we now call this “cancelling” someone. And the tendency toward this kind of behavior is called “cancel culture.” Perhaps more than anything else, cancel culture will be seen as an intrinsic part of life lived publicly in this decade, with the downfall of powerful Hollywood producers, racist and sexist comedians, white supremacists, and clueless corporations left in its wake. Cancel culture, not unlike cyberbullying, has also had its more “innocent” victims, ordinary citizens who said the unacceptable thing in a public forum. Is the destructive power of cancel culture too much? Many perceive this phenomenon of cancelling as a very new and scary thing that young people do, so much so that they’re ready to cancel the whole thing. Even Barack Obama weighed in on it recently, cautioning young people not to be overly critical and judgmental, as though the very idea of “cancelling” must always wrong and unreasonable, regardless of what is being criticized or how problematic it may be. Obama’s negative reactions to this kind of power being wielded by a groups that are relatively powerless, as an establishment figure (no matter how benevolently he presents himself), are perhaps not unusual. The social psychologist John Drury shows that the discourse around crowds, collectives, and people power have historically been problematic and negative, revealing the class biases and political ideologies of those commentators who describe them. Communities and crowds out of step with societal norms are often presented as something to be feared, and this is something many of us internalize. Crowds are scary. Even as we speak, there’s civil unrest, protests, demonstrations, and strikes happening all around the world, for a myriad of different reasons, in a decade that began with the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street protests. These movements have not often been described in flattering terms. The kind of language that’s used to talk about groups of people assembled together—or their collective actions seeking to change the status quo—often maligns communities as irrational, “mobs” or “rioters” with uncontrolled, invalid emotions, a kind of faceless contagion that presents a threat to civilized, law-abiding society and the ruling establishment. As Drury points out, this language systematically delegitimizes the aims of these collectives as being trivial, if not dangerous: If the crowd is pathologized and criminalized, then its behaviour is not meaningful. There can therefore be no rational dialogue with it. Since the crowd is not part of the democratic process, it is legitimate and even necessary to suppress it with the full force of the state. No one could argue that it’s pleasant to be at the bottom of a pile on, virtual or not. It’s true that people can band together for the wrong reasons, but, funnily enough, they can also band together for very good reasons. Cancelling someone, in terms of public shaming, or shunning, or just being criticized, is, again, nothing new, though it is arguably different in how quickly and severely it can happen online. The English professor Jodie Nicotra points out that such a thing has always been a part of community life and, in fact, a part of building and maintaining a community’s values. Whenever people have deviated from the norm, there have been public acts of shaming, from the scarlet letters or village stocks of Puritan life to the ritual public head shavings of thousands of French women who were suspected of fraternizing with German soldiers in World War II. Cancel culture is, on the one hand, less severe than these acts of public shaming, because it is mostly linguistic and communicative. On the other hand, it can seem more extreme, because unlike these historical events of past shaming, it’s unconstrained by geographical space and can involve large numbers of people in what can become an unrelenting personal attack. And that certainly can have unintended repercussions. Because social media, especially Twitter, is loosely joined together by a network of weak ties, it actually makes it easier for new, especially negative information, such as rumors or criticisms or even fake news, to spread quickly. It’s not constrained by closely linked social circles where information eventually stops spreading after repeatedly being shared by multiple people. This could explain why cancel culture seems so widespread, so virulently uncontrollable, and so dangerously unstable. It’s this that makes cancel culture very much a part of modern life. Rhetorical phenomena like virtual call-outs can spontaneously self-assemble a community based on #sharedbeliefs where there may not have been one before, tapping into a power that members of a group individually may never have had, but also reinforcing its evolving norms and values through language.

Δdocument.getElementById( ""ak_js_2"" ).setAttribute( ""value"", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); Nicotra suggests that virtual public shaming is a kind of “epideictic performance” in this way, an Aristotlean rhetorical act of blame or praise. Though we tend to focus on the negative of cancelling, we forget that there may be a good side—not just praise or approval, but the fact that injustices that were once allowed to thrive can now be revealed and acted upon by a group, and that group is made all the stronger by doing so. For example, if the group refuses to let a racist or sexist comment pass unchallenged, that reinforces its non-negotiable values and the group’s reason for being. The act of engaging in calling out problematic behaviors is the very thing that builds the bonds of a community, as members can agree or disagree with certain values or what counts as acceptable, express a joint disgust at certain behaviors, and use language developed by the collective to evolve a public morality and ethic to live by. Public call outs may not be always what a community wants to hear. It’s certainly not nice, but it’s what needs to be said for the same values to be debated, formed, shared, and upheld by everyone who belongs to the group. As language can be dangerous, and as crowd movements can be destructive, so can the cancel culture of “internet mobs” be damaging in the wrong contexts. So while it can be problematic, certainly very messy, and even judgmental, it’s cancel culture that also gives power to minority groups that historically have not had the luxury of speaking out. We need to understand that it can be powerfully misused, but can also shine a light on severe injustices that have been accepted for so long. Time will tell how this newly acquired power will work, but rather than simply discount cancel culture as yet another misguided millennial invention, it’s good to be aware that it’s always been a necessary part of our lives. It can often do as much good as it does harm. Support JSTOR Daily! Join our new membership program on Patreon today. JSTOR is a digital library for scholars, researchers, and students.

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11671789/,18-December-2019,Cancel Culture Is Chaotic Good,"Cancel culture may prove to be the most memorable linguistic trend of the past decade. As the year draws to a close, it’s hard to believe it’s also the end of a very strange and tumultuous decade. Who knows what the next ten years will bring? All signs point to a continuation of the same roller coaster ride of social, political, and environmental upheaval, except we’ll probably have to get used to endless puns about hindsight being 2020. It’s a good thing a nice cosy chat about language is kind of the Snuggie of polite, anxiety-free conversation we need these days. What did happen to language during the awkward teen years of the millennium? So many things! Most obviously, we could point to many emerging slang terms from the last ten years that left an impression, if the numerous hot takes by media commentators are anything to go by, from bae to YOLO to everything else that was on fleek and had everyone shook etc., etc. But while a lot of slang terms might be fire now (and not necessarily the dumpster kind), there’s no telling whether they have any staying power. Will “lit” become the 1870s “nanty narking” of the 2010s or “extra” the new “enthuzimuzzy?” As the novel impact of these terms become diluted, especially by those who are fellow-kids-ing their hearts out, they fall out of fashion, becoming less effective as a way to show where you belong. This is nothing really new, but looking deeper, how much do these slang terms really represent what went on in the last ten years? Although the internet has been around for a while (people often forget that the web, a virtual millennial at 25, is not the same thing as the internet, born in 1969, which would totally be Gen X if it cared, which, whatever), it’s really in this decade that internet language came into its own. There was a definite linguistic growth spurt from the real native speakers of the online world coming of age, building on successive waves of internet language. The ways we convey information now, not just through text but internet memes, emojis, gifs, short form video, and the language and meta-language we use to reference these new forms of creative communication, have all influenced mainstream language in fascinating ways. The hashtag, for example, birthed around 2007, soon became a commonplace but powerful element of online communication that not only linked information from different sources, it encapsulated what a spontaneous online community was centered around. Hashtags added nuance and meta-commentary to what was said. But our ways of speaking have been racing ahead faster than many of us can keep up with. While language change is not a new thing, thanks to the wide-ranging network of social media, it’s different in how fast and how virally it can spread now, as well as the impact it can have on real life, as speakers take up the linguistic trends used in their groups. Gender neutral “they,” for example, has been a thing for hundreds of years, yet today, it’s far more widespread and accepted, becoming Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s word of the year. What’s really remarkable is not just the random slang that comes and goes, but those neologisms that arose out of a desperate need, like gender neutral pronouns, that spoke to the real and urgent issues arising in society that demand a public debate and a way to talk about them. When we begin to reassess our identities, we also question where we belong and what we believe, together as a group. It’s terms like #MeToo and “woke” and even “fake news” that have resonance in today’s world, as a kind of call to arms, in a way that “on fleek” does not. These terms seek to open up to debate the things that were once blindly accepted and taken for granted. It’s these terms that may outlast the ephemeral slang cycle, and it’s these terms that reveal this decade’s remarkable preoccupation with self, community, belonging, beliefs, and the language that goes hand in hand with building these ties. Often we talk about language in innocent, superficial ways, as though new ways of communicating are exactly as they appear. This simplistic idea of language as, say, listicles of intriguing new slang conceals the fact that, in our post-truth world, language has become more overtly dangerous, and this can be both bad or good. Language has always been effectively used in propaganda or advertising to persuade masses of people, only now we have a better understanding of how it does this, as it’s become much easier, through social media, to use language as an effective weapon, a means of amplifying information of all kinds, by pretty much anyone who wants to (theoretically). And when you have masses of people not legally sanctioned to criticize social behaviors, this can be a concern to some. Judging from panic-stricken media commentary, sometimes it seems as though the one thing more frightening than a lone gunman (and it isn’t a young person responding to your well-intentioned life advice with “ok boomer”) is a random bunch of people who have banded together in some common cause. When this common cause is being aggrieved against someone’s problematic behavior, and results in “calling out,” silencing or boycotting the problematic behavior, we now call this “cancelling” someone. And the tendency toward this kind of behavior is called “cancel culture.” Perhaps more than anything else, cancel culture will be seen as an intrinsic part of life lived publicly in this decade, with the downfall of powerful Hollywood producers, racist and sexist comedians, white supremacists, and clueless corporations left in its wake. Cancel culture, not unlike cyberbullying, has also had its more “innocent” victims, ordinary citizens who said the unacceptable thing in a public forum. Is the destructive power of cancel culture too much? Many perceive this phenomenon of cancelling as a very new and scary thing that young people do, so much so that they’re ready to cancel the whole thing. Even Barack Obama weighed in on it recently, cautioning young people not to be overly critical and judgmental, as though the very idea of “cancelling” must always wrong and unreasonable, regardless of what is being criticized or how problematic it may be. Obama’s negative reactions to this kind of power being wielded by a groups that are relatively powerless, as an establishment figure (no matter how benevolently he presents himself), are perhaps not unusual. The social psychologist John Drury shows that the discourse around crowds, collectives, and people power have historically been problematic and negative, revealing the class biases and political ideologies of those commentators who describe them. Communities and crowds out of step with societal norms are often presented as something to be feared, and this is something many of us internalize. Crowds are scary. Even as we speak, there’s civil unrest, protests, demonstrations, and strikes happening all around the world, for a myriad of different reasons, in a decade that began with the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street protests. These movements have not often been described in flattering terms. The kind of language that’s used to talk about groups of people assembled together—or their collective actions seeking to change the status quo—often maligns communities as irrational, “mobs” or “rioters” with uncontrolled, invalid emotions, a kind of faceless contagion that presents a threat to civilized, law-abiding society and the ruling establishment. As Drury points out, this language systematically delegitimizes the aims of these collectives as being trivial, if not dangerous: If the crowd is pathologized and criminalized, then its behaviour is not meaningful. There can therefore be no rational dialogue with it. Since the crowd is not part of the democratic process, it is legitimate and even necessary to suppress it with the full force of the state. No one could argue that it’s pleasant to be at the bottom of a pile on, virtual or not. It’s true that people can band together for the wrong reasons, but, funnily enough, they can also band together for very good reasons. Cancelling someone, in terms of public shaming, or shunning, or just being criticized, is, again, nothing new, though it is arguably different in how quickly and severely it can happen online. The English professor Jodie Nicotra points out that such a thing has always been a part of community life and, in fact, a part of building and maintaining a community’s values. Whenever people have deviated from the norm, there have been public acts of shaming, from the scarlet letters or village stocks of Puritan life to the ritual public head shavings of thousands of French women who were suspected of fraternizing with German soldiers in World War II. Cancel culture is, on the one hand, less severe than these acts of public shaming, because it is mostly linguistic and communicative. On the other hand, it can seem more extreme, because unlike these historical events of past shaming, it’s unconstrained by geographical space and can involve large numbers of people in what can become an unrelenting personal attack. And that certainly can have unintended repercussions. Because social media, especially Twitter, is loosely joined together by a network of weak ties, it actually makes it easier for new, especially negative information, such as rumors or criticisms or even fake news, to spread quickly. It’s not constrained by closely linked social circles where information eventually stops spreading after repeatedly being shared by multiple people. This could explain why cancel culture seems so widespread, so virulently uncontrollable, and so dangerously unstable. It’s this that makes cancel culture very much a part of modern life. Rhetorical phenomena like virtual call-outs can spontaneously self-assemble a community based on #sharedbeliefs where there may not have been one before, tapping into a power that members of a group individually may never have had, but also reinforcing its evolving norms and values through language.

Δdocument.getElementById( ""ak_js_2"" ).setAttribute( ""value"", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); Nicotra suggests that virtual public shaming is a kind of “epideictic performance” in this way, an Aristotlean rhetorical act of blame or praise. Though we tend to focus on the negative of cancelling, we forget that there may be a good side—not just praise or approval, but the fact that injustices that were once allowed to thrive can now be revealed and acted upon by a group, and that group is made all the stronger by doing so. For example, if the group refuses to let a racist or sexist comment pass unchallenged, that reinforces its non-negotiable values and the group’s reason for being. The act of engaging in calling out problematic behaviors is the very thing that builds the bonds of a community, as members can agree or disagree with certain values or what counts as acceptable, express a joint disgust at certain behaviors, and use language developed by the collective to evolve a public morality and ethic to live by. Public call outs may not be always what a community wants to hear. It’s certainly not nice, but it’s what needs to be said for the same values to be debated, formed, shared, and upheld by everyone who belongs to the group. As language can be dangerous, and as crowd movements can be destructive, so can the cancel culture of “internet mobs” be damaging in the wrong contexts. So while it can be problematic, certainly very messy, and even judgmental, it’s cancel culture that also gives power to minority groups that historically have not had the luxury of speaking out. We need to understand that it can be powerfully misused, but can also shine a light on severe injustices that have been accepted for so long. Time will tell how this newly acquired power will work, but rather than simply discount cancel culture as yet another misguided millennial invention, it’s good to be aware that it’s always been a necessary part of our lives. It can often do as much good as it does harm. Support JSTOR Daily! Join our new membership program on Patreon today. JSTOR is a digital library for scholars, researchers, and students.

https://theseahawk.org/30325/thelatest/opinion-cancel-culture-is-toxic-and-does-more-harm-than-good/,24-January-2021,OPINION: Cancel culture is toxic and does more harm than good,"Hannah Horowitz, Staff Writer|January 24, 2021 The phenomenon of “cancel culture” only creates an environment of hostility across various social media platforms. For those unfamiliar with the concept, it involves publicly calling out, shaming and boycotting celebrities and their products. However, its usage has stretched beyond celebrities and is now used to target the average citizen. As a result of cancel culture , ordinary people have faced consequences such as losing their jobs, being shunned by friends and family, or having to remove their online presence. Cancel culture is believed to create a sense of accountability for those who say or do controversial things. Instead, it creates an environment where harassment and bullying are accepted and embraced. Social media gives anyone the opportunity to weigh in on the person being “canceled,” which not only jeopardizes that person’s safety, but also puts them at risk for being alienated completely. Unfortunately, that is sometimes the goal in these types of cancel culture situations. A few days ago, I was scrolling through social media when I came across a reposted picture of a woman wearing a shirt that said the words “Drunk Wives Matter” in the style of a BLM (Black Lives Matter) shirt. Out of curiosity, I clicked on the original post to read the comments. In a matter of minutes, people on the platform had joined together to find this woman’s employer, her property owner, extended family and even the person who watches her dog. Several had already contacted her employer and her property owner in hopes of getting her fired from her job and out of her apartment. While her decision to buy the shirt and post a photo of it was deplorable, those who were “canceling” her do not seem to understand it that only creates a sense of resentment. In a country where repairs to relations are already crucial, it seems unnecessary to cause extra harm. It is not creating a sense of accountability for her actions; it is simply harassment. Those who took part in “canceling” her felt a sense of power and purpose in doing so, but the action did not address any of the institutional issues that come along with it. There is a reason this woman decided to buy the shirt and then post it for everyone to see. It does not make her a white supremacist; it makes her an incredibly ignorant and uneducated person. Chances are, she does not understand why. “Canceling” her is the opposite of the educational culture that we must instead create. When someone is experiencing hate, especially over social media, their first instinct is to defend oneself and justify their actions. They are not going to be open to hearing what others say and instead are put on the defense, seeing every comment as a threat. If this woman genuinely believes that she did nothing wrong, she is either going to stay silent or seek affirmation from others who also believe that her actions were not wrong. She is going to disregard the commentators as “haters” or those who are just overly sensitive to a shirt that she thought was funny. The next day, there will be someone else being canceled, as this is a temporary situation for her. The constant instances of cancel culture solve nothing. There are greater issues beyond this single woman buying a shirt. The shirts are openly mocking Black Americans struggle for justice in this country. Someone decided to create and market these shirts to the public, and a quick Google search confirms just how many retailers have hopped on the trend. These retailers only believe that their product is marketable due to the Fox News personalities and members of Congress who reinforce the belief that BLM is not something to take seriously, but to mock. This country is dealing with not just deeply rooted white supremacy, but the certain phrases such as “white privilege” and “Black Lives Matter” trigger those who do not understand the foundation of those phrases. As I mentioned before, the first reaction is often justification or deflection, which is why we hear “I don’t have privilege” and “All Lives Matter” in response. There is a conspicuously obvious educational gap when it comes to the coverage of American History. Non-people of color have a moral duty to understand why systemic racism exists and persists in this country. Cancel Culture must become educational culture. Former President Obama weighed in on cancel culture, saying “That is not activism,” to those who take part in the public harassment and shaming of others. I include his quote not because he was the first Black president, but because he spent years in his early twenties supporting and working on grassroot campaigns. As a young person who also takes part in grassroots activism, it is deeply troubling to hear cancel culture being expressed as activism. Instead of taking part in the hateful rhetoric, I urge others to instead concentrate their efforts into voter’s rights organizations, civil rights organizations, LGBTQIA+ organizations, or wherever their passion drives them. There are too many who face lawful discrimination to this day, and the focus should be on extending equal rights to all Americans. Racism and ignorance do not deserve a platform and cancel culture does just that. Instead, we need use those same platforms to amplify the voices who are pushing for positive change, rather than allowing others to pull us decades back.

Not only does this ruin the purpose of the neutrality of the argument, but really exposes that the article’s purpose is not to deflect cancel culture. Agreeably, the deflection of cancel culture is not to concede to the other side by “taking efforts into voter’s rights organizations” which are rather controversial in the twenty-first century. Rather, there is really no solution to cancel culture unless we have civil conversations with one another, instead of jumping to conclusions. We should continue to talk to each other instead of trying to find one-sided solutions and thinking it is a one-size fits all. Grey • Sep 2, 2021 at 6:04 pm The way I see cancel culture used the most is to socially execute someone. Destroy their life whether their guilty or not, or their “crime” is large or small. It’s a step up from the toxic comments of “Go kill yourself racist trash!” To “we will just kill yourself for you.” And sometimes they succeed and drive the victim to suicide, and celebrate. That’s all you need to see to recognize many SJW’s are sociopaths. I also don’t see any differentiation between levels of social “crimes.” Wearing a drunk wives matter t-shirt, admitting you’ve said the n-word in your life, or blowing up a black church: It’s all the same 10/10 hate-filled reaction. SJWs want to bully people into conforming to their beliefs, or you’ll be sorry. I’m an American and I support freedom of speech and beliefs. You have every right to believe what you want. I’m gay, and I don’t like to be actively harassed in public. It’s rude and cruel for others to inflict their beliefs on me without my consent. Do I want to attack someone for not approving of gays personally, but do not act of those beliefs? No. They have their right to believe whatever they chose, right or wrong, it’s not my business if they are keeping their beliefs private. I don’t care what you believe, so don’t care what I believe. Now when politicians or people advocate for banning gay marriage, Sodomy laws, etc., then that is inflicting their beliefs on me and I’ll fight to defend my rights. Cancel culture is a social support movement for women’s rights, black rights, trans rights, etc. Small people have big power now to attempt to force immediate social change, which before would take decades to do. I’m all for social change and making the world a more fair place because there are many problems. The worst offense cancel culture has is being led by emotions. People become a hive mind of anger and want retribution. They misplace all of their and societies problems onto the offender. Rational and pragmatic thinking? Forget about it. “That scum of the earth didn’t put his fist up to support black lives matter/women’s rights/anti-abortion, kill him!” It’s one of the worst traits of groups of humans, and it may never go away. It is ALWAYS better to think rationally and pragmatically about why you are angry, who is this offender, what is the evidence, what can we do to make things better, etc… Think before you act. And most importantly, think for yourself. Don’t be a blind follower. Michael Murphy • Apr 25, 2021 at 7:47 pm Ms. Horowitz had me until 7th paragraph. “All lives matter” is not simply a deflection, but a deep belief many people from all different racial and ethnic backgrounds have. It is LESS racist to say “all lives matter” than “black lives matter.” Additionally, the BLM movement or organization really is an anti-American crusade rather than for the benefit of black Americans. And racism is not systemic in our country although it certainly does exist to an extent in all groups. If racism is still systemic, there would be no black police officers or members of congress, for example. But I do agree with Ms. Horowitz that Cancel Culture is indeed harmful in our society and needs to be eradicated. No one should lose their job or property for merely saying “all lives matter.” Matt • Mar 7, 2021 at 1:52 pm I think in a time when people expect honesty and integrity, for people to get along and weed out bullying the people who are so easily offended are embracing exactly the opposite. Its not enough to simply call out somebody who the offender but to destroy their reputation and in some respects their lives. People do this using social media platforms as weapons. Some cancel culture is ok but there are always those who will push the boundries. The victims of cancel culture have little to no recourse. The people in support of their cancelling have promoted bullying and the failure to accept accountability. The exact opposite of what they desire if only to ignore their own social insecurities. People need thicker skin before they create a future generation of thin skinned children that will not possess the mental faculties to deal with issues that are universally offensive vs their expectations of how the people around them are supposed to behave. They won’t be happy until everything in life is censored and all those freedoms and liberties are swallowed up in policies and policing.

Cancel culture—the practice of withdrawing support from individuals or companies who have done or said something offensive—can be helpful in making social change. Canceling someone for an unforgivable action can be an effective way to hold people accountable for their actions and combat inequality, such as sexism and racism. The cancellation of public figures like Louis C.K. and J.K. Rowling is part of a larger movement to stop sexual harassment and transphobia. But when it comes to teenage cancel culture, the negative mental health effects outweigh the positives. Teens are still forming their identities and their beliefs. They need the chance to learn from their mistakes rather than being punished. For many teens, getting canceled is the worst punishment imaginable. Rejection by their peer group is their biggest fear. That’s why there’s a link between cancel culture and mental health. Being canceled can lead to teen anxiety, depression, trauma, and suicidal thoughts and behavior. The term cancel culture gained traction in the 2010s as a method of holding people or brands accountable for their words and actions. Canceling happens via boycotts and public shaming, And sometimes this can be a powerful means of social justice. For example, the “MeToo” movement shined a spotlight on sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace. Hollywood elites, like Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, to CEOs and politicians were fired or faced legal actions as a result. A poll conducted five years later found that 70 percent of Americans “believe that the movement has made it more likely that people would be held accountable for workplace sexual harassment and assault.” While cancellation automatically labels someone as bad and irredeemable, there is a slightly gentler “calling out” or “calling in.” In this way, the person becomes aware of the wrongdoing and has the opportunity to apologize, learn and do better moving forward. Cancel culture and social media go hand in hand: Cancel culture wouldn’t have gained nearly as much momentum over the past decade without social media. The primary means of canceling an entity or individual is through blocking, unfollowing, and/or verbally targeting them on social media platforms. According to cancel culture statistics collected by the Pew Research Center, 58 percent of Americans believe that calling someone out on social media holds them accountable for their actions, while 38 percent believe it punishes people who don’t deserve it. For some, it’s career ending. Ellen DeGeneres faced backlash after former employees called her out for fostering a toxic work environment on her daytime talk show. According to a New York Times report, the show lost million viewers after her public apology—a 43 percent decline. It went off the air in 2022. Social media gives teens a sense of connection with celebrities, and encourages them to mimic cancel culture behavior with peers. Much of teenage cancel culture takes place online, through comments and unfollows. In teenage cancel culture, classmates or social media “friends” boycott a teen who says or does something problematic, like making racist or homophobic comments, telling a tasteless joke, or misgendering someone. Teens also cancel each other for other reasons, such as being a toxic friend, being too needy or self-centered, or even watching the wrong shows or listening to the wrong music.

Step 1 of 2 – 50% Δdocument.getElementById( ""ak_js_1"" ).setAttribute( ""value"", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); Being called out by your peers can be apowerful learning and growing experience for teens. However, cancellation in high school isn’t just a teaching moment; it’s a harsh punishment and public shaming. It is especially damaging because this age group is so sensitive to the opinions of their peers. A review of research on media and adolescent brain development found that teens are particularly vulnerable to social influences because the regions of the brain involved in the social aspects of life are still maturing. Moreover, brain imaging studies show that social rejection literally hurts: It lights up the same parts of the adolescent brain that are activated by physical pain. Being socially ostracized, at an age when peer connections are incredibly important, is devastating. Outside of social media, cancellation can also happen in real life, at school or in activities outside of school. Canceled teens are often left out, snubbed, bullied, ignored, and isolated. Many therapists report treating teen clients who suffered from depression, anxiety, and suicidality for months after being canceled by peers. Teens who experience this may struggle for years to trust themselves, to trust others, and to feel a sense of belonging in a peer group. The harmful effects of cancel culture also extend to the cancelers and the bystanders. Teens who cancel others may do so because they have strong moral convictions, and that’s a good thing. But teenage cancel culture gives them permission to bypass empathy and forgiveness in favor of being right. Rather than learning to have debates about topics they disagree on, cancelers simply shut out those they deem wrong. As for the teens on the sidelines, they often suffer from anxiety and fear that they will be next, and/or guilt about not standing up for someone who was harshly canceled. “The instant nature of social media means that very large, complicated social issues get condensed into one sentence, one minute for TikTok [videos] or just a photo on Instagram. Everything is becoming very succinct, and it both discourages nuanced discussion and encourages all-or-nothing stances. Cancel culture is ‘You’re all good, or you’re all bad,’ and human nature is much more complicated than that.” Amanda Koontz, UCF Associate Professor of Sociology, University of Central Florida It’s important for parents to have conversations with teens about cancel culture and mental health. Here are some tips for parents to help prevent the harmful effects of cancel culture. Cancel culture can be bullying or cyberbullying if it is used in a way that shames and ostracizes a classmate. That’s true even if someone who has done something offensive. Talk to them about the importance of understanding what others feel and think, even if you don’t agree with them. Even if the issues don’t seem serious to you, recognize how meaningful they might be to teens. Encourage open discussion about cancellation and how it affects people on all sides of the issue. That means thinking twice before posting on social media. Also avoid engagement when you’re feeling emotional. Consider limiting the amount of time teens spend on social media. Do they feel like canceling people is the only way they can keep friends or be a leader? Has canceling become an unhealthy way for them to boost their self-esteem? Explore more effective ways that they can share their beliefs and values. Use this as an opportunity to discuss it, and help them see why what they said or did was hurtful. Acknowledge and sympathize with their pain, and equip them with some approaches for resolving conflict or apologizing. If the cancellation continues, help your teen find positive connections elsewhere. Additionally, make sure they receive mental health support if needed. It’s traumatic to experience the pain and shame of being canceled, in addition to the loneliness and isolation of being ostracized, can be traumatizing. The experience can catalyze depression, anxiety, and co-occurring disorders like substance use. Treatment helps to heal these wounds and supports teens to rebuild self-esteem and authentic connections. At Newport Academy, teens create strong, trusting relationships with peers and discover that they are not alone in their experiences.

Cancel culture refers to the public shaming of a person or organization because they have said or done something that is strongly offensive. Fueled by social media, cancel culture often results in a boycott or withdrawal of support for the person or organization being targeted. Cancel culture can help bring about social change and give a voice to the less powerful. However, cancel culture can lead to online bullying or threats. It can also keep people from speaking their mind on issues or voicing their opinion for fear of retribution. The pain and shame of being canceled, in addition to the loneliness and isolation if a teen is ostracized by their peers, can be traumatizing. Teens can experience depression, anxiety, and co-occurring disorders like substance use. There are mixed thoughts on the issue. Many feel it is a way to hold people accountable for their words or actions, while others feel that it does not offer the opportunity for people grow and learn from their mistakes.

https://www.insidehook.com/internet/youthsplaining-everything-you-need-to-know-about-cancel-culture,20-August-2019,Youthsplaining: Everything You Need to Know About Cancel Culture,"Sometimes the internet goes over our heads. Luckily, we have a college student on staff to help us navigate those times. This is cancel culture, youthsplained. The cancellations never stop pouring in — and I’m not talking about all the shows Netflix has decided to end so abruptly. I’m talking about all the times we “cancel” celebrities, media personalities and really anyone with a social media platform we decide they’re using inappropriately. You may have heard the term “cancel culture” pop up just last week when comedian Sarah Silverman said on an episode of “The Bill Simmons Podcast” that she thought “cancel culture” should itself be canceled, adding that social shaming is “really scary” and referring to the whole thing as “righteousness porn.” Silverman was fired from a movie recently, after a 2007 photo of her in blackface resurfaced, even though she has since apologized for the photo, going so far as to draw attention to it in an interview for GQ last year. The comedian argued on the podcast that cancel culture leaves no room for growth. “I’m not saying, ‘Don’t hold me accountable,’ ” she said. “I held myself accountable. I can’t erase that I did that, but I can only be changed forever and do what I can to make it right for the rest of my life.” When two allegations of sexual misconduct against Katy Perry were reported last week, there was a small campaign on Twitter to cancel the singer — evidence of which you can find when you search the hashtags #KatyPerryIsOverParty (the customizable hashtag format typically used in cancelation campaigns) or #SurvivingKatyPerry, a play on the “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary that exposed his history of sexual assault. However, those tweets are few in comparison to other historic cancelations, which is probably because we don’t take sexual misconduct allegations against women as seriously as we do those against men, which, yes I know, is fucked up. It can also be because Perry has a swarm of dedicated fans, hell bent on convincing the world of her innocence, who created the counter hashtag #KatyPerryIsLovedParty. Cancel Culture is one of the more complicated trends to hit the internet in recent years. Some argue that it’s too harsh, others argue that it just doesn’t have any real consequences. Certainly it has ruined people’s reputations and chances at business opportunities, in many cases rightly so, but it has also created a mob-like mentality thereby any minuscule mistake makes it open season for intense backlash. But there’s a lot to unpack here so we might as well get to it. According to Wikipedia — yes, there is a Wikipedia page — there are two variant terms for the trend. The term call-out culture is a form of public shaming which occurs on social media (usually Twitter) that aims to hold people accountable by calling attention to behavior that is deemed problematic. Cancel culture is a form of boycott in which someone, typically a celeb, has shared a questionable opinion, or again, has had problematic behavior called out on social media. That person is then “canceled,” which essentially means they’re boycotted by a large number of people, sometimes leading to massive declines in the person’s fanbase and career. This usually begins when a person says or expresses an opinion that is racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/xenophobic. Most often it is something that person has said in their distant past that has been found and re-posted, bringing new attention to it. This can be screenshots of old tweets or old videos that resurface of the problematic behavior in question. These types of cancellations have been especially prominent in the world of beauty YouTubers. In 2018, make-up artist Laura Lee lost over 300,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel and had businesses and sponsors sever ties with her after tweets from 2012 resurfaced that showed her making racist remarks. She uploaded a 4-minute apology video that was criticized for being insincere and for her apparent “fake crying,” which then eventually became a meme. Related:Why Is Every Young Person You Know Drinking Hard Seltzer?You’ve Been Texting the Word “Okay” Wrong But it can happen for bigger name celebrities too. Kevin Hart stepped down from hosting the 2019 Oscars because of resurfaced homophobic tweets, with much of Twitter, including celebs, calling out his behavior. This eventually got the attention of the Academy who asked Hart to apologize. The backlash only increased after Hart refused to apologize, and it was only after he announced he was stepping down from hosting duties that an apology also ensued. no apology no mention of the lgbt community, just imagine if this was about any other marginalised group pic.twitter.com/AtJ8I51tOR Then there are the cancelations that can occur from less severe circumstances. Back in 2016, Taylor Swift was “canceled” after the internet accused her of “always playing the victim” after she got into a feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West over a lyric in West’s song “Famous.” Kim K called Swift a snake, using the snake emoji, of course, and pretty much the entire rest of the internet followed suit. Wait it's legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days! 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍 In a recent interview with Vogue, Swift said that the entire experience felt isolating. “I don’t think there are that many people who can actually understand what it’s like to have millions of people hate you very loudly,” said Swift. “When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, Kill yourself.” Well, it’s complicated. Calling out someone, especially someone who has great influence, for their harmful behavior or ideas is something that we should continue to do. Call-out culture has especially been helpful for people of color and LGBTQIA+ communities in keeping their spaces free of shitty people. But then many have also brought up that the mob-mentality of cancel culture can be toxic, and as Sarah Silverman pointed out, these mass social media campaigns against a person can actually hinder them from growing and learning from their mistakes. Instead of “canceling” them, we should be educating them. It depends, and it’s not necessarily even clear on what. Another beauty guru, Jeffree Star, was also called out during the time of Laura Lee’s cancellation for saying the N-word in an old video. But while Lee was pretty much canceled for good, Star is still one of the most popular people on YouTube, with over 15 million subscribers, a wildly successful makeup brand and millions of followers across other social media platforms. Taylor Swift has gone through the wringer of “cancelations” as well, and she’s still the #1 female artist in the world. Kanye West was “canceled” for his support of Trump, Kim Kardashian gets called out almost daily for culture appropriation — yet they’ve still got millions of fans and will remain among the richest people in the world. Many have argued that cancel culture exists only in the Twitter bubble. It can seem as if a celeb’s entire existence is finished when thousands of users start hashtagging “___IsOverParty,” but in the real world, it might not even cross people’s minds. Which might be why bigger name celebs have an easier time bouncing back from scandals, and why YouTubers and Instagram influencers whose businesses and brands live solely in the realm of the internet are more often the subjects of cancelation campaigns — and have a harder time bouncing back. Plus having a large army of diehard fans willing to clutter feeds with tweets in your defense, like in the case of Katy Perry, can also help higher-powered celebs come back from the cancelation dead. The other day I mentioned “cancel culture” in passing to a friend and they had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. Life away from Twitter is wild. What’s certain is that cancel culture has started to lose its impact in recent years. Maybe because at times it has spiraled out of control and been used for the wrong reasons, forcing people to start questioning it. Or maybe we’ve become immune since people in high places — the highest of all the places, one might say — can now say and do whatever they want without being held accountable or subject to any consequences.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/06/09/a-growing-share-of-americans-are-familiar-with-cancel-culture/,09-June-2022,A growing share of Americans are familiar with ‘cancel culture’,"Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World Read our research on: Full Topic List Read Our Research On: | Americans have become increasingly aware of the phrase “cancel culture,” according to a new Pew Research Center survey. And when it comes to calling out other people for posting potentially offensive content on social media, the public has become somewhat more likely to see this type of behavior as punishing people who didn’t deserve it, rather than holding them accountable. Overall, 61% of U.S. adults say they have heard at least a fair amount about the phrase “cancel culture,” up from 44% in September 2020, the first time the Center asked about the term. Since then, several major news stories have highlighted the phrase, while politicians and the media have debated the term and what it means. The share of Americans who are unfamiliar with the term “cancel culture” has shrunk 17 percentage points since 2020. But there are still about four-in-ten who say they have heard not too much (16%) or nothing at all (23%) about the phrase. Awareness of cancel culture has grown across demographic groups, but one of the largest increases has come among older adults. The share of adults ages 65 and older who say they have heard a great deal or a fair amount about cancel culture has risen from 33% in 2020 to 53% today. Pew Research Center has a long history of studying the tone and nature of online discourse, as well as emerging internet trends. This analysis focuses on American adults’ familiarity with the term “cancel culture” and their perceptions about calling out others on social media. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,074 U.S. adults from April 25 to May 1, 2022. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions, responses and methodology used for this analysis. Despite this increase, adults under 30 remain the most likely age group to say they have heard of the phrase. About three-quarters of 18-to 29-year-olds (77%) say they have heard at least a fair amount about the phrase, with 53% saying they have heard a great deal. Roughly six-in-ten adults ages 30 to 49 and about half of adults 50 and older say they have heard a great deal or fair amount about the term. College graduates also stand out as being more likely to have heard of cancel culture: 77% say they have heard at least a fair amount about it, compared with 63% of those with some college education and 45% of adults with a high school diploma or less formal education. Cancel culture is a highly politicized topic, and Republicans and Democrats are equally likely to have heard about it. Around six-in-ten Republicans and GOP-leaning independents (63%) have heard a great deal or fair amount about the term, as have a similar share of Democrats and Democratic leaners (62%). When accounting for ideology, liberal Democrats (79%) and conservative Republicans (69%) are more likely than their more moderate counterparts within each party to say they have heard at least a fair amount about cancel culture. However, liberal Democrats stand out as the most likely group to be familiar with the term. The Center’s previous study of cancel culture showed that the term can mean different things to different people, so Pew Research Center asked Americans a separate question about whether calling out others on social media for posting content that might be considered offensive is more likely to hold people accountable or to punish those who didn’t deserve it. Overall, 51% of U.S. adults say calling out others on social media is more likely to hold people accountable, while 45% say it is more likely to punish people who didn’t deserve it. But these views have shifted somewhat since September 2020. The share of adults who say this type of behavior is more likely to hold people accountable has decreased by 7 points, while the share who say it is more likely to punish people who didn’t deserve it has gone up by 7 points. Views on this question continue to differ widely by partisan affiliation. Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that, in general, calling people out on social media for posting offensive content holds them accountable (65% vs. 34%). Conversely, 62% of Republicans – but only 32% of Democrats – believe this type of action generally punishes people who didn’t deserve it. However, the share of Democrats who see this behavior as punishment has risen 10 points since 2020. There has also been a 6-point increase in the share of Republicans who see calling out others on social media as unjustly punishing people. Among Republicans, conservatives are more likely than moderate or liberal Republicans to see calling out others for sharing potentially offensive content on social media as generally punishing people who didn’t deserve it (65% vs. 57%). Similarly, Republican men are more likely than Republican women to say they see this behavior as a form of punishment (68% vs. 56%). There are no differences in Democrats’ views by ideology, but Democratic women are more likely than their male counterparts to say they see calling out others as a form of accountability (69% vs. 61%). There are also gender differences on this question among Americans overall. Women are more likely than men to say that when people publicly call out others on social media for posting content that might be considered offensive, it is more likely to hold people accountable for their actions (56% vs. 45%); conversely, men are more likely to say this behavior is more likely to punish people who didn’t deserve it (52% vs. 38%). There are also differences by race and ethnicity. Black adults stand out as particularly likely to see calling out others on social media as a form of accountability, with 71% saying this is the case. Somewhat smaller shares of Hispanic and Asian adults say the same (61% each), while 44% of White adults say they see calling out others on social media for potentially offensive content as generally holding people accountable. White adults are somewhat more likely to say this behavior generally punishes people who didn’t deserve it (51%). Roughly four-in-ten Hispanic and Asian adults share that view (38% each), as do 26% of Black adults. Topics Emily A.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/kianbakhtiari/2020/09/29/why-brands-need-to-pay-attention-to-cancel-culture/,29-September-2020,Why Brands Need To Pay Attention To Cancel Culture,"ByKian Bakhtiari ByKian Bakhtiari, Contributor. getty Over the past few years, “cancel culture” has entered the mainstream lexicon, thanks to social media. Fast forward 2020, the term has become central to public debate across politics, culture and media. In short, cancel culture refers to the practice of withdrawing support for a person or company — often on social media — based on their views or actions. The current pandemic has only served to increase the cultural impact of the internet on society. Ever since the physical world went into lockdown, people have been spending a record amount of time online. At the same time, social isolation has further facilitated online interaction. Thus, sparking a renewed wave of social activism amplified by the Black Lives Matter movement. All these factors combined, make cancellation one of the most contested issues of the decade. What’s more, this is likely to be the start of an enduring battle to maintain or reshape the prevailing narrative through which we live our lives. A battle that is bound to have major implications for brands and marketers. Critics of cancel culture view the movement as a modern form of mob rule. Cancellation prevents open debate which has long been the foundation of democracy. After all, the ability to entertain different ideas and perspectives creates the conditions for social progress. Some of the greatest breakthroughs in human history have occurred when cultures have shared and exchanged contrary ideas. Whereas cancel culture can summarily execute opposing viewpoints without any due process or context. The rise of the term’s popularity has even mobilized 150 public figures to denounce the prevalence of cancel culture. Notable signatories include J.K Rowling, Salman Rushdie, Margarete Atwood, Malcolm Gladwell and Noam Chomsky. The open letter in Harper’s magazine warns against a vogue culture of public shaming. It states, “The free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted.” The letter comes after J.K. Rowling was canceled on Twitter for a series of social media posts and essays described as “transphobic.” Online cancel culture is accused of promoting cultural censorship as seen when HBO Max’s removal of Gone with the Wind (recently returned with a disclaimer), Cops and Little Britain. Many film critics argue that old content shouldn’t be deleted but understood within the context of that particular time in history. If we simply cancel all art considered offensive through the lens of modernity: what would we be left with? And is it possible to separate the art from the artist? If not, what happens to the works of Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling, Richard Wagner, John Wayne and many more. In contrast, supporters view cancel culture as an important tool in achieving social justice. The internet, in particular, social media provides a platform for the historically underserved to share their views, opinions and lived experiences. In many ways, Twitter offers an outlet for groups excluded from traditional institutions – such as politics, education, economy and media – to have a say. Today, marginalized groups are no longer solely reliant on prejudiced establishments built for the privileged few. Every citizen with access to the internet can now write an opinion piece, share their story and speak truth to power. A single Tweet has the power to plummet share prices, hold politicians accountable and force celebrities to admit to wrongdoings. Put another way, cancel culture represents the voice of the voiceless. But there’s also a deeper layer of social, cultural and historical context that can be applied to the cancel culture debate. It could be argued that cancel culture doesn’t actually exist. Instead, the term has become a convenient red herring to silence legitimate protests and maintain the status quo. From this perspective, what we’re seeing is an authentic attempt to right historical wrongs and push for meaningful change. For example, so-called cancel culture was instrumental in making the #MeToo campaign go mainstream. Making sure that #BlackLivesMatter has been used on Twitter and Instagram since 2014. And rallying millions of people globally to protest against climate change. It could be argued, cancel culture is a synonym for legitimate criticism from groups — who until recently — lacked the means to express themselves. More recently, the cancel culture debate has spilled over into the world of marketing and advertising. Historically, brands have stayed out of politics — for good reason — taking sides can alienate a large chunk of their customer base. But in today’s increasingly polarised climate, not taking sides can be the bigger risk. Brands can no longer afford to remain neutral because neutral is viewed as complicit. That being said, empty statements of solidarity no longer suffice either. The consumers of today are more informed and empowered than ever before. They expect you to turn your words into action. And if brands don’t stick to their promises, consumers possess the knowledge, determination and platform to call them out. In short, there’s nowhere to hide. According to a study by Edelman, 64% of consumers around the world will buy or boycott a brand solely because of its position on a social or political issue. Only a few years ago, the term boycott was viewed as something confined to the radical fringes of society. But today, boycotting has become a mainstream consumer reaction. And it’s not only directed towards socially irresponsible brands. But also, towards brands seen to be overplaying their social and environmental credentials. For example, Swedish vegan milk brand Oatly has long been a favorite for eco-friendly consumers. However, fans of the alternative milk brand have started boycotting the company after it sold $200 million in shares to a consortium that includes Blackstone following a Twitter thread accusing the investor of contributing to deforestation in the Amazon. Similarly, Lululemon has been under fire for promoting an event about “decolonizing gender” and how to “resist capitalism” despite the companies $45 billion market valuation. Although consumers are increasingly demanding brands to take a stand. It’s equally important to remember, 56% believe too many brands use societal issues as a marketing ploy to sell more of their product. In the race to reflect societal values, brands are becoming ever more reactive, but doing so can lead to consumer backlash unless the sentiment is backed by authentic action.",bykian bakhtiari bykian bakhtiari contributor getti past cancel cultur enter mainstream lexicon social medium fast forward term central public debat polit cultur medium short cancel cultur refer practic withdraw support person compani social medium base view action current pandem serv increas cultur impact internet societi physic world lockdown peopl spend record amount time onlin time social isol facilit onlin interact spark renew wave social activ amplifi black life matter movement factor combin cancel contest issu decad start endur battl maintain reshap prevail narr live life battl bind major implic brand market critic cancel cultur view movement modern form mob rule cancel prevent debat foundat democraci abil entertain idea perspect creat condit social progress breakthrough human histori occur cultur share exchang contrari idea cancel cultur summarili execut oppos viewpoint due process context rise term popular mobil public figur denounc preval cancel cultur notabl signatori includ rowl salman rushdi margaret atwood malcolm gladwel noam chomski letter harper magazin warn vogu cultur public shame free exchang inform idea lifeblood liber societi daili constrict letter rowl cancel twitter seri social medium post essai transphob onlin cancel cultur accus promot cultur censorship hbo max remov wind recent return disclaim cop britain film critic argu content shouldn delet understand context time histori simpli cancel art consid offens len modern leav separ art artist mark twain rudyard kipl richard wagner john wayn contrast support view cancel cultur tool achiev social justic internet social medium platform histor underserv share view opinion live tongu stick erienc twitter offer outlet exclud tradit institut polit educ economi medium margin sole reliant prejudic establish build privileg citizen access internet write opinion piec share stori speak truth power singl tweet power plummet share price hold politician account forc celebr admit wrongdo cancel cultur repres voic voiceless deep layer social cultur histor context appli cancel cultur debat argu cancel cultur doesn exist term conveni red her silenc legitim protest maintain statu quo perspect authent attempt histor wrong push meaning chang call cancel cultur instrument metoo campaign mainstream blacklivesmatt twitter instagram ralli million peopl global protest climat chang argu cancel cultur synonym legitim critic recent lack mean tongu stick ress recent cancel cultur debat spill world market advertis histor brand stai polit reason take alien chunk custom base increasingli polaris climat take big risk brand afford remain neutral neutral view complicit empti statement solidar suffic consum inform empow tongu stick ect word action brand don stick promis consum possess knowledg determin platform call short hide studi edelman consum world bui boycott brand sole posit social polit issu ago term boycott view confin radic fring societi boycott mainstream consum reaction direct social irrespons brand brand overplai social environment credenti swedish vegan milk brand oatli favorit eco friendli consum fan altern milk brand start boycott compani sell million share consortium includ blackston twitter thread accus investor contribut deforest amazon similarli lululemon fire promot event decolon gender resist capit compani billion market valuat consum increasingli demand brand stand equal rememb brand societ issu market ploi sell product race reflect societ valu brand reactiv lead consum backlash sentiment authent action,50,2,0.20524573465749935,0.28545963840081484,0.12324929971988795,0.07155589508530685,0.07155589508530685,0.17137764196587726,0.07155589508530685,50,Celebrity Culture & Brand Boycotts

Grayling’s new book Discriminations: Making Peace in the Culture Wars sees the renowned philosopher wading into the ethical minefields of “woke” activism, cancellation, and conservative backlash. Filled with thoughtful analysis, deep reflection, and fascinating historical detail, Discriminations argues the differences between leftist moderates and “woke activists” centrally concern means rather than ends. Review: Discriminations: Making Peace in the Culture Wars (Oneworld Publications) The book’s core contribution lies in Grayling’s searching examination of “othering”. This allows him to explain the core ethical concern about racism and sexism while simultaneously providing a principled basis to resist the more intolerant strategies that might be used in the struggle against such evils. “Woke” and “wokist” now have pejorative implications and are terms used mainly by critics of progressive views. Grayling defines “wokism” in terms of the passionate advocacy of things like: • Critical Race Theory in history classes • Campaigning for same-sex marriage • Educating about diversity in sexuality • Supporting medical gender transition • Advocating changes in language use, such as with non-gendered pronouns • Encouraging Me Too avowals. A significant number of identity politics activists, he adds, “promote no-platforming and cancellation as weapons in the struggle”. This last point is critical in the way Grayling pictures the differences between moderate leftists like himself and “woke activists”. After all, the bulleted list above – apart perhaps from the reference to Critical Race Theory – includes many concerns broadly shared across the political left. For Grayling, the differences between moderates and activists are mainly ones of strategies they employ to achieve their shared social justice goals. Through their justifiable anger at systemic injustice, he argues, some “woke activists” have been drawn into employing weapons like no-platforming and cancellation. These tactics can sometimes be morally mistaken, especially when driven by online mobs. Grayling worries that the use of these practices can “other” their targets, without any attempt at due process and constraints of proportionality. Discriminations stands in stark contrast to another recent work on wokism: Yascha Mounk’s The Identity Trap. Like Grayling, Mounk is a moderate leftist. Like Grayling, he is critical of woke activism. But that is where their similarities end. For Mounk, wokism is not a continuation of traditional leftist civil rights struggles but a sharp deviation from them. On this view, wokism (which Mounk calls “the identity synthesis”) differs from liberal progressivism not merely in means but fundamentally in ends. Mounk sees wokism as committed to three foundational claims: the world must be understood through the prism of identities like sex, race and gender; supposedly universal rules merely serve to obscure how privileged groups dominate marginalised groups; and a just society requires norms and laws that explicitly treat (and require citizens to treat) different identity groups differently. None of these are claims about means; they concern fundamental values and goals. For Mounk, woke intolerance – in the form of cancellation and no-platforming – is a feature, not a bug. In contrast, Grayling sees online cancellations (when they go wrong) as a betrayal of the traditional leftist values he shares with the woke activists. Grayling understands cancelling as efforts to “deprive opponents not only of a platform to state their views, but to deprive the persons and groups themselves of a presence.” This can include social ostracism and getting people fired. Discriminations contains no detailed discussions of contemporary cases of cancellation and their impacts. This is deliberate. Grayling worries that discussing current cases might invite an automatic identification with the cancelled target. Alternatively, it might counter-productively draw attention to victims who have already been excessively targeted. Granting these points, the absence of any case studies carries costs. For one thing, it’s never shown in the book that these objectionable practices are widespread enough to warrant a movement against them. Equally, there is no appeal to the reader’s sympathies by examining cases of cancellation through social media pile-ons and the human costs involved. Unless the reader already believes these practices to be widespread and harmful, they are unlikely to see what all the fuss is about. Without examination of actual cases, it also can be hard to know exactly what Grayling is recommending. Grayling believes cancelling is often justified. However, he wants to make clear the serious problems it creates in the cases where it is not justified. The problem is that different readers, interpreting some of his terms differently, might be led to see an act of cancellation as justified accountability where another reader would see objectionable mob justice. Grayling defines “othering” as the practice of treating individuals and groups, typically on the basis of stereotyping and prejudice, as a ground for discriminating against them; and discrimination involves exclusion. Othering occurs any time one group of people decides they are different to another group (which they see as the “other”), thus treating that group in a morally different and worse way. Racism and sexism are examples of othering and “exclusion”. Grayling argues the goal of social justice is necessarily opposed to all such othering, especially if the exclusion is done without proportionality and safeguards, like due process. (Grayling allows that criminal punishment can be a type of justified othering.) Crucially, Grayling argues that acts of cancellation and no-platforming are instances of othering. These practices explicitly involve attempted punishment, shaming and ostracism and often occur without due process. Suppose you are a progressive activist concerned about the injustices of systemic racism and sexism. You might have strategic reasons that constrain the methods you use in fighting those injustices. However, your concerns with racism and sexism will generally not themselves restrain the methods you use. But suppose now you accept Grayling’s argument that the root social justice concern is not with racism or sexism specifically, but rather with the more fundamental injustices of othering and exclusion. Because cancelling and no-platforming are themselves instances of such things, you now have a deeply held reason not to cancel others (except perhaps in the most compelling cases). You do not want to become the very thing you are fighting against. Should we accept Grayling’s argument? There are some worries his notions of othering and exclusion are over-broad, given they capture commonplace practices like national borders and criminal justice punishments. Overall though, Grayling shows through his historical discussions that political othering for ideological or doctrinal reasons has caused enormous injustices and even horrifying slaughters. It turns out that political and ideological intolerance – Grayling recounts religious massacres and China’s Cultural Revolution – has a history every bit as awful as racially motivated massacres like the Holocaust. As he sombrely concludes: “tragedy attends entrenched positions that make mutual comprehension impossible”. Grayling stresses it is right to feel anger at the world’s injustices. But a wariness of being drawn into othering should incline us towards what he terms “Aristotle’s Principle”: to be “angry with the right person, in the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose”. Grayling adopts a human-rights-based approach as his moral compass, seeing it as a system that can transcend different cultures and parochial outlooks. He endorses the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – importantly including the right to free speech. Cancelling can impinge on people’s free speech rights. As well as being wrong in itself, Grayling emphasises it’s also a strategic mistake. Activism itself requires free speech and it is unwise to “gift the high moral ground on free speech” to one’s political opponents. (That said, the political right in the United States is currently showing itself to be no friend of free speech either.) Grayling distinguishes rights and interests. He argues, “no exercise of any right can deny the fundamental rights of others.” Too often, he insists, figures on both sides of politics interpret their opponents as violating their rights when the opponents are just impacting on their interests. Grayling is surely correct that all sides of politics could benefit from seriously thinking through the differences between rights and interests. Setting back someone’s interests is not the same as violating their rights. Interests are inevitably in conflict and always require negotiation and compromise. Still, there remains something of an elephant in the room. What if an opponent’s words or actions don’t violate anyone’s rights, but nevertheless plausibly contribute to a world where such violations are more likely? Arguably, the problem of political intolerance isn’t driven by a conflation of rights with interests, but instead the ease with which any attack on a group’s interests can be represented as an indirect attack on their rights. It is a hard task to define an amorphous, contested and evolving concept like “wokism”. Grayling’s definition seems to map reasonably onto the original idea of being “woke to” (that is, newly aware of) structural racism and other inequities. But as Grayling himself observes, “woke” is now more commonly used as a pejorative term. The linguist John McWhorter argues the term has evolved from describing those with a leftist political awareness to referring to “those who believe anyone who lacks that enlightenment should be punished, shunned or ridiculed.” This is very different from Grayling’s understanding of the term. Most of the attributes Grayling ascribes to “the woke” are standard leftist positions. Worryingly, this sometimes seems to prevent him from engaging seriously with what many of the “woke” actually say and believe. For example, Grayling reflects on those who say that wokist social justice has been strongly influenced by postmodernism. Postmodernism includes the denial of things like “objective truth” and “factual knowledge” on the basis that these are constructs of power and discourse. But Grayling finds this confusing. After all, postmodernism seems to undercut the objective values of equality and social justice. He concludes: What this suggests is that those who begin with the postmodern analysis of objectivity and knowledge are not actually saying that there are no such things, but that how they have been constituted in the past should be replaced by new and better conceptions of them. This is simply not what the postmodernists are saying. The worry here is that Grayling takes it upon himself to stipulate what another school of thought is “actually” saying, rather than listening carefully to their ideas and arguments, and being open to the possibility that these may differ profoundly from his own. Given the book aims to persuade the woke activists he thinks are going too far in cancelling others, the possibility Grayling is misreading their actual position is a concerning one. Throughout, he appeals to the importance of democracy, free speech, human rights, the rule of law and due process, and the Enlightenment. He argues from what he sees as empirical evidence and “common knowledge”. But all these notions are wide open for criticism (from the woke perspective) that they are inventions of racist, patriarchal, and colonialist systems of oppression. As such, Grayling’s arguments may fall flat for the very group he is trying to persuade because he does not take their beliefs seriously enough to engage directly and critically with them. So who is right? Is Grayling correct that woke activists are just like him, except they have been led by their shared passions for social justice to indulge in often counter-productive and mistaken strategies of cancellation? Or is Yascha Mounk correct? Is wokism a profound departure from traditional leftist social justice goals? Perhaps time will tell.

DiscussionMy cancel story (self.CancelCulture) submitted 1 year ago by CYSYS8992 I was in a Discord server for a year and a half only to suddenly get banned out of nowhere permanently because it turned out others were complaining and reporting me behind my back the entire time, saying my posts were making them ""uncomfortable"". Granted, I did a few misbehaviors but I acknowledged them and vowed to improve myself after. But aside from those I wasn't breaking any rules or harassing anyone to begin with, I was just being myself and no less an active member there like everyone else, posting appropriate content in the appropriate channels. I wasn't even given a chance to say anything on the matter to appeal the ban or make any objections saying that all those reports were false or at least unproven. All it took was a bunch of people using the magic words ""makes me uncomfortable"" and I was automatically guilty thus needs to face punishment to the utmost degree, and the reports made about me are completely legit and justified. All this would've been avoided if the owner just rejected all those phony reports made about me because I wasn't blatantly rule-breaking or overall being a piece of shit. But no, even the owner was complicit in all this and simped for all those false reporters, saying they're in the right and my permanent unappealable ban is totally deserving and blocked me, destroying any chance of ever joining that server again. Naturally, I got angry at this display of sheer injustice and unfairness, of not only getting wrongly accused but also the owner still choosing to listen and believe those phony accusers without question and ban me anyway like they weren't; getting robbed of any future possible opportunities over just overall being myself as an individual, and the owner and presumably those same accusers had the gall to label me a narcissist who doesn't accept responsibility for his actions. TL;DR: I was wrongly banned from a server simply by being myself then was ironically labeled a narcissist when I got angry about it. Post a comment! [–]Speckyoulater 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (1 child) What were your ""misbehaviors""? What'd they say you did that you don't think you did? [–]CYSYS8992[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (0 children) I posted in the wrong channel and beat myself up over it. They never went into further detail on what I was getting banned over. [–]Global-Psychology376 3 points4 points5 points 1 year ago (8 children) Or maybe you 'being yourself' makes people uncomfortable and you should try to change [–]CYSYS8992[S] 3 points4 points5 points 1 year ago (0 children) If something about 'myself' was making them uncomfortable and they told me about it I'd be willing to change that, but the only time they did was AFTER I got banned permanently. [–]CYSYS8992[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (5 children) Unless a part of me being myself is obviously toxic and destructive, I doubt it. [–]strawberry_kerosene 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (2 children) keep being yourself ❤️ you aren't here to please anybody [–]CYSYS8992[S] 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago* (1 child) The bigger issue is that those who are not pleased are somehow automatically in the right which I must accept without question. [–]strawberry_kerosene 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (0 children) They're not in the right but go off bud [–]Global-Psychology376 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (1 child) You don't have to be toxic to make other people feel uncomfortable. A pair of pants doesn't have to completely stop your blood flow to feel uncomfortable. And It's completely reasonable to stop wearing uncomfortable pants and stop interacting with uncomfortable person [–]strawberry_kerosene 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (0 children) yeah so i should not be gay if it makes a hetero uncomfortable, i should quit using chewy.com if it makes people uncomfortable where i purchase food for my dog? no one is on Earth to please you. [–]PowerToDaPeople 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago (0 children) Gay people kissing each other make me uncomfortable. According to your way of thinking I should cancel them? [–]FrostyLandscape 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (3 children) I tend to be blunt and that makes people uncomfortable. Were you telling the truth about things or clarifying you were just stating opinions? Some places online are toxic no matter what. I was in a group for parents and it quickly became toxic. They had certain people they would literally get ""text alerts"" when that person posted, so they could gang up on them. [–]CYSYS8992[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (2 children) I don't know exactly. All they said was my posts were making them uncomfortable and that's it. They refused to elaborate any further. [–]strawberry_kerosene 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (0 children) did it include porn or sexual references, etc., were you shipping scavengers and dragons (you'll understand if you read WoF)? look back at your posts. if the answer is no to these then they're jerks. [–]FrostyLandscape 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (0 children) Pretty sure you can rejoin the server if you just get a new ISP which is easy to do. [–]justmikeplz 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (3 children) I am sorry you got kicked off that Discord server. It clearly hurt you. The truth is, while we could/should all be ourselves, that doesn’t mean it comes without consequences. Some people are just naturally pleasant, without trying. Others have default personalities/behaviors/opinions that can bother others. Not everyone is supposed to fit in everywhere. When people look at themselves and strip away the bias, perhaps they can see what others see. The truth will still always be subjective, but it is normal in social and business groups for people to suppress some of their own undesirable traits/opinions in order to fit in. Everybody is doing it. Some people will have to do it more than others, but it is a price to pay in order to get something else that is valued or enjoyed. Also, sometimes these social pressures are great clues about things we can work on within ourselves. Of course, everyone has work to do, and not everyone is interested in adopting a mindset of continuous improvement. One thing for sure— sulking on the internet and being defensive about someone else you see as being defensive, is not continuous improvement. I suggest you stop obsessing, learn from your past and move on. You are probably missing out on life that is happening all around you. By the way, you seem to have indicated you knew there were probable issues before you got “canceled”. You made a choice to not change your behavior. You have no one to blame but yourself. That Discord server was nothing anyway. Here’s to a new life. I wish you all the best. [–]Anessor 0 points1 point2 points 10 months ago (2 children) Yeah but what exactly got him banned? [–]justmikeplz 0 points1 point2 points 10 months ago (1 child) If you read their account history, you can figure it out. [–]Anessor 0 points1 point2 points 10 months ago (0 children) Not really, op just said he got banned for making people feel uncomfortable but he wasn’t told how, that’s literally why I’m asking [–]Lawdatory 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (1 child) I hate to have to ask but did your identity versus the complainers identity have anything to do with it? Ie are you white and they are nonwhite? Or vice versa? Are you hetero and they are queer? Are you a man and they are women?

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/07/us/cancel-culture-accountability-reality-trnd/index.html,07-March-2021,It’s time to cancel this talk of ‘cancel culture’,"What, exactly is cancel culture? Is it someone getting fired for harassment or problematic views? No, that’s a workplace doing its job. Is it a popular figure losing fans or affiliations because of their past actions? No, that’s the power of public opinion. Is it a company choosing not to publish a book, or a group of people boycotting a brand? No, that’s just the free market at work. Cancel culture, as it’s understood today, isn’t real. Not only do people and things allegedly “canceled” by this imaginary movement often prevail in the end, the whole concept is a smoke screen to distract from actual systemic forces of suppression. Let’s take a look at some recent victims of so-called cancel culture. Related article The real reason for the Dr. Seuss freakout Dr. Seuss Enterprises, the group that handles the iconic author’s legacy, announced a handful of his titles, out of dozens, will no longer be printed or sold because of racist depictions. These books are not illegal to own, and in fact, many libraries have said they are actively finding ways to keep these titles on their shelves with context around their troubling content. Still, some people cried “cancel culture” and within days, mainstream Seuss titles like “The Cat in the Hat” were topping bestseller lists. Related article Country music's race issue is no surprise Bestselling country artist Morgan Wallen faced criticism after he was caught saying a racial slur on camera. Some radio stations decided to stop playing his songs, but they climbed up the Spotify charts nonetheless, and his album sales and social media followers skyrocketed. So far, his career has certainly not be canceled. Neither were the careers of Lana Del Ray, Doja Cat, Camila Cabello, Justin Bieber or other singers accused of racist speech. Related article Gina Carano fired after social media posts Gina Carano, who played a supporting role on Disney’s “The Mandalorian,” was fired after comparing the treatment of conservatives to the Holocaust. She’s not banned from getting work, and in fact has already landed herself another gig – funded by conservative pundit Ben Shapiro. Cancel culture is nothing new. Its philosophy – that anyone can be excoriated for speaking their mind, that people are too sensitive, that the slightest offense can be fatal – is just a repackaged extension of the decades-long culture wars and the “political correctness” dialogue popular in the 1990s. It’s also a remix of common First Amendment and censorship arguments, which often vastly misinterpret the constitutional and legal bounds of both terms. For instance, conservatives have long alleged “censorship” of like-minded voices on Twitter and Facebook, when data analysis shows the volume and reach of conservative content is quite strong and often outperforms other content. Related article The First Amendment doesn't guarantee you the rights you think it does The term “cancel culture” actually began among vast, amorphous social media groups and online fandoms. Fans of, say, a particular music group or Youtuber often celebrate the missteps of rival groups or stars, saying they’re “canceled” or “over.” Taken as a piece of internet parlance, the bombast and performativity is quite clear, and even on these less visible levels of online discourse, one usually doesn’t stay “canceled” for long. (Singer Shawn Mendes and Youtuber James Charles are two examples of this type of cancel culture. Each has literally millions of followers and fans, and their careers don’t seem much worse for the wear). So people targeted by “cancel culture” are almost never actually canceled. However, proponents of this imaginary force want you to believe its victims prevail not because cancel culture doesn’t exist, but because it can be thwarted. That argument breaks down when those very proponents have to apply the same logic to people within their fold. Related article CPAC cancels speaker over anti-Semitic social media comments It’s no secret cancel culture has been adopted as a cause du jour among conservative celebrities. Ohio Representative Jim Jordan recently called for a House Judiciary hearing on cancel culture, saying it was causing a wave of censorship across the country. The theme of this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference was even “American Uncancelled.” And yet, the conference ended up canceling a speaker who expressed anti-Semitic views online. This dissonance reveals cancel culture for what it is: Accountability for one’s actions. Women afraid to speak up for fear of being blacklisted, LGBTQ people hiding their identities to protect their careers or lives, people shunned for their culture or their views: These are the real problems that exist. It’s not cancel culture. To know the difference, look at the people who actually suffer when these culture wars play out. In 2016, Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the national anthem at an NFL game. After that season, he hasn’t played football since. In the ensuing years, Kaepernick and Eric Reid, another player who knelt, filed grievances against the NFL, saying the league was colluding to keep them from being picked up by other teams. The early fallout from the #TakeAKnee protests were met with studied indifference by many NFL leaders, and former President Donald Trump and countless other political figures repeatedly cast wide and sometimes violent derision their way. Related article Why the NFL just can't seem to get politics right Where are the anti-cancel culture warriors in Kaepernick jerseys? Where are the anti-cancel culture warriors fighting for men and women who allege wrongdoing at great risk to their own career? It’s very convenient that the same people who want to convince you that cancel culture is real also seem to be the ones determining who is worthy of being saved from such a fate, and who is not. That’s because cancel culture isn’t real. There is accountability. There are legal repercussions. There are tides of public opinion and the pull of the free market. There are also longstanding institutional structures that serve to suppress and threaten those who act against the interests of those with power. None of this is cancel culture. And by pretending otherwise, we’re distracting ourselves from seeing the patterns of who really benefits from this rhetoric, and who really loses. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/cancel-culture-debate-needs-greater-specificity/629654/,28-April-2022,The Real Reason Cancel Culture Is So Contentious,"People on both sides of the debate are being too vague about what they favor and what they oppose. Sign up for Conor’s newsletter here. The majority of Americans who insist that “cancel culture” is a problem and the minority who counter that it is a fraud, a myth, or a moral panic are too often talking past one another. One faction invokes the term cancel culture as shorthand for a range of complaints: for instance, that figures such as the political analyst David Shor and Emmanuel Cafferty, a California utility-company worker, lost their jobs after innocent acts that provoked unreasonable offense in others; that universities have unjustly punished hundreds of scholars for protected speech in recent years; or that so many Americans are self-censoring that deliberative democracy is threatened. Another faction dismisses complaints about cancel culture and reframes the status quo as “accountability culture.” This shorthand encompasses what many regard as long-overdue consequences for figures such as Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, two entertainment-industry giants credibly accused by multiple women of sexual assault, and the former NBA owner Donald Sterling, who was pushed out of the league after recordings of his racist comments surfaced. Using any one term to frame such varied controversies hides the actual lines of disagreement. People who complain about “cancel culture” should always clarify what they oppose. They should be told: Be more specific, unless you’re literally saying that no one should ever be fired or stigmatized for anything they say or do. Likewise, people who laud “accountability culture” or dismiss cancel culture as a myth should be told: Be more specific about what you consider fair punishment, unless you’re literally saying that everyone fired or stigmatized for speech was treated justly. Conor Friedersdorf: The threat to free speech, beyond ‘cancel culture’ Before going any further, I’ll lay my cards on the table. Although I dislike the term cancel culture because of its vagueness and potential for misinterpretation, I tend to think that “cancel culture” is a problem, by which I mean: Inevitably, fair societies impose social sanctions on some bad behaviors. But fair societies also levy such sanctions in ways that the average citizen understands and accepts. They frown on arbitrary or excessive sanctions. And they reserve the most extreme extralegal punishments, such as public shaming, shunning, or depriving people of their livelihood, for extreme cases. If everyone were more specific, people who come down on opposite sides of the abstract, 30,000-foot debate over cancel culture might find some agreement about concrete cases. To illustrate how greater specificity could keep the two sides of the debate from talking past each other, consider a 2021 Mother Jones article with the headline “Roxane Gay Says Cancel Culture Does Not Exist.” Indeed, that’s precisely what Gay, a best-selling feminist author, tells her interviewer: Cancel culture, she says, “is this boogeyman that people have come up with to explain away bad behavior and when their faves experience consequences. I like to think of it as consequence culture, where when you make a mistake—and we all do, by the way—there should be consequences.” Yet in the next breath, Gay seems to acknowledge that punishments are not being meted out fairly: “The problem is that we haven’t figured out what consequences should be,” she says. “So it’s all or nothing. Either there are no consequences, or people lose their jobs, or other sort of sweeping grand gestures that don’t actually solve the problem at hand.” The interviewer’s next question was about the podcast Reply All, which had reported on allegations of unjust workplace dynamics at the magazine Bon Appétit but canceled the series before it was finished, because similar accusations arose against Reply All’s own host. “I think it’s a mistake,” Gay declared. “I understand that the reporting is not finished on the final two episodes. But this is not the Mona Lisa. Somebody can finish these stories. I think the Bon Appétit story is interesting. And it’s typical. And it deserves to be told.” As it turns out, Gay and I agree that a journalistic institution imposed a wrongheaded “consequence.” Its decision makers solved no problems while stymieing a valid inquiry into a worthy subject. That’s more common ground than one would expect from the headline of the Mother Jones article. In the same spirit, I agree that, absent a rigorous definition of cancel culture, bad actors can exploit any ambiguity to deflect legitimate criticism of their conduct. “Why should we care about having a serious discussion about defining cancel culture?” asks the attorney Ken White, who is deeply skeptical of the term. “We should because simply complaining about it in the abstract, without attempts to define it, without actionable responses, and without taking the rights of ‘cancellers’ doesn’t ease the culture war. It inflames it.” He’s right. Read: How capitalism drives cancel culture That said, the most incisive critics of cancel culture have specifically defined when a line is crossed, as they see it, from vigorous public disagreement with someone’s views to misguided attempts to stifle their expression. The free-speech activist Greg Lukianoff defines cancel culture as “the measurable uptick, since roughly 2014, of campaigns to get people fired, disinvited, deplatformed, or otherwise punished for speech that is—or would be—protected by the First Amendment.” In the higher-education sector, which Lukianoff tracks closely, he and Komi T. German note: Since 2015, we documented 563 attempts (345 from the left, 202 from the right, 16 from neither) to get scholars canceled. Two thirds (362 incidents; 64 percent) of these cancellation attempts were successful, resulting in some form of professional sanction leveled at the scholar, including over one-fifth (117 incidents; 21 percent) resulting in termination … In 2001, the idea of one tenured professor being fired for protected speech seemed impossible, yet since 2015 there have been 30. The author Jonathan Rauch offers a list of cancel-culture tells, which include “Are people denouncing you to your employer, your professional groups or your social connections?” “Is the tone of the discourse ad hominem, repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged?” “Are [campaigners] claiming that allowing you to be heard is violence against them or makes them unsafe?” The writer Wesley Yang has published videos, tweets, and essays fleshing out his theory that “cancel culture” is how activists pursue “the politicization of everyday life, the rule of didacticism in art, and the installation through coercive means of a dysfunctional new moral system by a tiny and unaccountable elite.” Have any of the critics who dismiss cancel-culture concerns made a commensurate attempt to flesh out which punitive social norms are desirable, to define “accountability,” or to specify when it is warranted? Americans will never achieve consensus about exactly which behaviors are beyond the pale—or what should happen to those who violate accepted norms. But even contested yet clearly understood rules (like the comedian George Carlin’s famous seven words you couldn’t say on TV) are better, if adopted provisionally by institutions or consistently adhered to in public discourse, than an alternative in which taboo lines are so murky that all manner of adjacent speech is chilled and many people refrain from speaking publicly at all for fear of unwittingly transgressing. In some cases, the standards are kept vague because more specific ones would be indefensible. If you want to know which faction is abusing its relative power in a given sphere of society, ask who sees no problem with opaque taboos versus who is worried that they will unduly stifle speech. In states solidly controlled by Republicans, for example, populist-right legislators want to punish certain categories of speech related to race or sex, likely chilling some expression that they could not persuade majorities to ban specifically, and progressive educators are noticing that vague and malleable standards guarantee such speech-dampening excesses. At Ivy League universities, progressive faculty members and DEI administrators are the ones pushing to punish certain kinds of speech related to race or sex, in many cases launching investigations into poorly defined transgressions, and centrist liberals and conservatives are the ones pointing out the danger of vague and malleable standards. When any faction with power fails to clarify which statements and behaviors it would punish (as opposed to merely criticize) if given the chance, its members might like the fact that they are chilling the speech of their culture-war antagonists. A dearth of clarity is hugely useful for wielding social control. It leaves everyone guessing. But a self-governing people shouldn’t have to guess at what speech is forbidden and what’s allowed.",peopl debat vagu favor oppos sign conor newslett major american insist cancel cultur minor counter fraud myth moral panic talk past faction invok term cancel cultur shorthand rang complaint instanc figur polit analyst david shor emmanuel cafferti california util compani worker lose job innoc act provok unreason offens univers unjustli punish hundr scholar protect speech recent american censor delib democraci threaten faction dismiss complaint cancel cultur refram statu quo account cultur shorthand encompass regard overdu consequ figur harvei weinstein bill cosbi entertain industri giant credibli accus multipl woman sexual assault nba owner donald sterl push leagu record racist comment surfac term frame vari controversi hide actual line disagr peopl complain cancel cultur clarifi oppos tol tongu stick specif liter fire stigmat likewis peopl laud account cultur dismiss cancel cultur myth tol tongu stick specif fair punish liter fire stigmat speech treat justli conor friedersdorf threat free speech cancel cultur lie card tabl dislik term cancel cultur vagu potenti misinterpret tend cancel cultur inevit fair societi impos social sanction bad behavior fair societi levi sanction averag citizen understand accept frown arbitrari excess sanction reserv extrem extraleg punish public shame shun depriv peopl livelihood extrem specif peopl opposit abstract foot debat cancel cultur agreement concret illustr specif debat talk past mother jone articl headlin roxan gai cancel cultur exist precis gai sell feminist author tell interview cancel cultur boogeyman peopl tongu stick lie bad behavior fave tongu stick erienc consequ consequ cultur mistak consequ breath gai acknowledg punish mete fairli haven figur consequ consequ peopl lose job sort sweep grand gestur don solv hand interview question podcast repli report alleg unjust workplac dynam magazin bon app tit cancel seri finish similar accus aris repli host mistak gai declar understand report finish final episod mona lisa finish stori bon app tit stori typic deserv tell gai agre journalist institut impos wronghead consequ decis maker solv stymi valid inquiri worthi subject common grind tongu stick ect headlin mother jone articl spirit agre absent rigor definit cancel cultur bad actor tongu stick loit ambigu deflect legitim critic conduct care discuss defin cancel cultur attornei ken white deepli skeptic term simpli complain abstract attempt defin action respons take right cancel doesn eas cultur war inflam rea tongu stick capit drive cancel cultur incis critic cancel cultur specif defin line cross vigor public disagr view misguid attempt stifl tongu stick ression free speech activist greg lukianoff defin cancel cultur measur uptick roughli campaign peopl fire disinvit deplatform punish speech protect amend educ sector lukianoff track close komi german note document attempt leav scholar cancel third incid percent cancel attempt success result form profession sanction level scholar includ incid percent result termin idea tenur professor fire protect speech imposs author jonathan rauch offer list cancel cultur tell includ peopl denounc employ profession social connect tone discours hominem repetit ritualist postur accusatori outrag campaign claim allow hear violenc make unsaf writer weslei yang publish video tweet essai flesh theori cancel cultur activist pursu politic everydai life rule didactic art instal coerciv mean dysfunct moral system tini unaccount elit critic dismiss cancel cultur concern commensur attempt flesh punit social norm desir defin account warrant american achiev consensu behavior pale happen violat accept norm contest understand rule comedian georg carlin famou word couldn adopt provision institut consist adher public discours altern taboo line murki manner adjac speech chill peopl refrain speak publicli fear unwittingli transgress standard vagu specif indefens faction abus rel power sphere societi opaqu taboo versu worri unduli stifl speech solidli control republican populist legisl punish categori speech relat race sex chill tongu stick ression persuad major ban specif progress educ notic vagu malleabl standard guarante speech dampen excess ivi leagu univers progress faculti dei administr push punish kind speech relat race sex launch investig poorli defin transgress centrist liber conserv danger vagu malleabl standard faction power fail clarifi statement behavior punish oppos critic chanc chill speech cultur war antagonist dearth clariti huge wield social control leav guess govern peopl shouldn guess speech forbid allow,54,6,0.08539505187549881,0.12450119712689545,0.11193136472466081,0.15522745411013567,0.06025538707102953,0.36193136472466086,0.10075818036711891,54,Cultural Sanctions & Cancel Justice
https://mentalhealthathome.org/2021/04/09/what-is-cancel-culture/,09-April-2021,What Is… Cancel Culture,"A safe place to talk openly about mental health & illness A safe place to talk openly about mental health & illness In this series, I dig a little deeper into the meaning of psychology-related terms. This week’s term is cancel culture. Cancel culture is an odd phenomenon spawned by the social media era. Some argue that it poses a threat to freedom of speech. I didn’t know enough to write an opinion post on it, so I decided to put this post within the what is… series to find out what others have to say about it. Cancel culture seems to encompass a few different issues, and there doesn’t seem to be a consensus on what exactly that mix is. One element is the free expression of ideas in the context of university lectures and other activities. Then there are things getting dredged up from 20 years ago and showing up in everyone’s Twitter feed, like Canadian PM Justin Trudeau’s brownface photo from 20 years ago that surfaced a couple of years back. You’ve also got publications in the present that are considered offensive, with repercussions for those who wrote and published the offending story. We can’t forget the outing of criminal behaviour such as with Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, and Kevin Spacey. Then there are influencer spats on social media, which seems to have happened with James Charles, whoever he is. Then there’s the role of Twitter and mass-shaming. That’s a lot going on, and I’m still not clear which bits cancel culture does or does not encompass. This perhaps has to do with concept creep, which refers to the semantic expansion of terms so they come to include more things than they originally did. According to a USA Today article, “The phenomenon occurs when people get upset about something that a company or person has done or something they have said. It also can be divisive with opposers saying threats of cancellation stifles free speech.” That seems to point in the direction of the masses on social media being the driving force, which may motivate a company to react by firing an offending individual to avoid tarnishing their brand. A Politico article says that cancel culture is generally “performed on social media in the form of group shaming.” In a poll they conducted, 46% of Americans believed cancel culture had “gone too far.” 27% of respondents thought it had a positive impact on society, while 49% believed its impact was negative. 40% said they’d participated in cancel culture, with 10% saying they did so often. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to participate. There’s a big generation gap, with Gen-Z and Millennials favouring cancel culture and Gen-X and Baby Boomers being against it. Besides the younger generations in general, not everyone thinks that cancel culture is necessarily a bad thing. The Wikipedia article on the topic quotes a media studies professor who calls cancelling the “ultimate expression of agency” (agency in that sense is the ability to not only make but enact free choices) and a way to achieve “accountability which is not centralized. A JSTOR Daily article says “It’s true that people can band together for the wrong reasons, but, funnily enough, they can also band together for very good reasons. Cancelling someone, in terms of public shaming, or shunning, or just being criticized, is, again, nothing new, though it is arguably different in how quickly and severely it can happen online.” That’s a very good point. The nature of Twitter makes it very easy for negative information to be distributed widely and rapidly. According to JSTOR Daily: “This could explain why cancel culture seems so widespread, so virulently uncontrollable, and so dangerously unstable… Rhetorical phenomena like virtual call-outs can spontaneously self-assemble a community based on #sharedbeliefs where there may not have been one before, tapping into a power that members of a group individually may never have had, but also reinforcing its evolving norms and values through language.” In 2020, “A Letter on Justice and Open Debate” was printed in Harper’s Magazine, signed by 153 prominent authors and academics, including Noam Chomsky, Steven Pinker, J.K. Rowling, Salman Rushdie, and Gloria Steinem. The letter called out modern censoriousness for “an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty.” It adds, “The restriction of debate, whether by a repressive government or an intolerant society, invariably hurts those who lack power and makes everyone less capable of democratic participation. The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away.” There was a rebuttal letter published in The Objective, “A More Specific Letter on Justice and Open Debate.” It called out the Harper’s letter writers for being highly privileged and ignoring how things like racism and transphobia have long silenced people. I didn’t recognize any of the signatories, and several people contributed anonymously. The Harper’s letter authors were definitely coming from a place of privilege in the sense of having respect and a large platform from which to be heard. Focusing on that, though, seems like a distraction from the message itself. Nick Cannon was fired by CBS after making antisemitic comments on his podcast. Is that cancel culture, or is that CBS making a decision they don’t want antisemitism associated with their brand? No one’s stopping him from having his podcast; he’s definitely not short of a platform. Roseanne Barr had her tv show cancelled after a series of racist tweets. Cancel culture, or ABC deciding nuh-uh, we’re not okay with that? She has a right to say what she wants, but her employer doesn’t have to like what she says. Freedom of speech in the First Amendment sense means that government can’t interfere by, say, throwing someone in jail for what they say, as happens in so many countries where there are significant limits to freedom of speech. It doesn’t mean that people have to be okay with what you have to say, and it seems like what cancel culture is all about is the people en masse imposing consequences because they don’t like what’s been said. In my recent blog post about freedom of speech, someone commented about how cancel culture should be stopped so that people are able to have free, democratic speech. But if cancel culture happens in large part on Twitter, where the masses go to behave like there are no consequences, is that not in a sense democratic? It’s not pretty, by any means, but it’s a whole bunch of people collectively deciding that they’re not okay with someone/something. Cancel culture only exists in this way because social media has given the masses of random people the power to express their opinions in a way they just wouldn’t have been able to back when I was a kid. If cancel culture is ugly, is that just a reflection of what our society is? What are your thoughts? The Psychology Corner has an overview of terms covered in the What Is… series, along with a collection of scientifically validated psychological tests. Ashley L. Peterson BScPharm BSN MPN Ashley is a former mental health nurse and pharmacist and the author of four books. I think you’re right that the phrase “cancel culture” brings together a bunch of different things that aren’t the same. It’s one thing to stop following a famous person who you disagree with. It’s quite another thing to agitate to have them fired and banned from working ever again unless they apologise. I’ve kind of followed the “It’s just consequences of bad opinion X” in the past, but the definition of “bad opinion” is in the eye of the beholder. It’s hard to feel sorry for someone who loses popularity or even their job because of a racist tweet, but what if someone loses popularity with a certain subset of their audience (or worse) because they come out as gay? There are certainly people out there who feel that being gay is an objectively bad thing like being racist. I don’t really trust either society or the law to police the difference. George Orwell said that the highest form of totalitarianism is one without a secret police, and which is policed entirely by peer pressure, because humans are naturally gregarious and want to be liked. I think we may be about to experience that… I hadn’t heard what Orwell said, but that does sound a whole lot like where Twitter is heading. It does seem to encapsulate many different things and raises lots of questions. You make good points Ashley. Lots of questions – now if only there were some answers…. Very true! Canceling takes less energy than listening, empathizing, offering a counter opinion, and choosing to coexist with differences. It’s about believing you’re right and the other is wrong. It’s about labeling people and reducing their humanity to a judgment. It strips away the context of their life. Shaming is violence. It’s ineffective at changing people authentically. When people act because they are shamed, it’s unlikely their actions will contribute to life-affirming energy. We’re just trying to get them to do what we want. That’s called coercion. Instead of shaming and canceling, we could appeal to common humanity, education, opportunities for change. Cam Newton made comments in a press conference a few years ago that were deemed misogynistic. So we can end his public life or try to educate him about why his comment offended so many people. If he doesn’t change by choice, then realize he’s not your go-to source for equality-minded speech. Not everyone in life will check all our boxes. If the left cancels the right and the right cancels the left, then we’re just not talking to each other, but nobody’s mind has been changed. When speech goes underground, it can get warped, violent. We aren’t condemning people who cancel. Humans make mistakes. If mistakes get us canceled, then we are shunned from society. That is violence, too. We are not fans of eye for an eye. We think love is the only antidote to hate. Very interesting read. BTW, James Charles is a makeup artist My question would be how does change happen? I agree that cancel culture isn’t a good thing, but it’s so diffuse it seems hard to know what to grab onto in order to promote change. Interesting post Ashley. However, I know very little about cancel culture and I am confused by the whole concept. It seems to be a creature of the social media age, and perhaps it can only really be understood by people entrenched in that culture. I didn’t know what cancel culture was until I read your post, Ashley. This is a hard one for me. I’m not sure how I feel about it. I can forgive an idiot dressing in brownface when he was young, but if someone has raped people and ruined their lives, I have no problem with their reputation being destroyed. I think harmful intent plays into that too. It likely didn’t cross Trudeau’s mind that he might be harming anyone then or later, but Weinstein knew exactly the kind of harm he was causing. Interesting post, interesting comments. I’m a little confused by lumping criminals into the mix tho – Harvey Weinstein wasn’t cancelled, he was convicted in a court of law – there’s a difference between trial by jury and trial by Twitter. I’m confused in general about the whole topic, but I think the issue with celebrities who’ve been convicted is whether the work they’ve created gets targeted to be cancelled. That’s less of an issue with Weinstein since he’s not overtly present in his work, but more so with R. Kelly or Bill Cosby. Ah, the Michael Jackson problem… Yup. By choice. No one has to change just because other people want them to. But some people genuinely don’t want to offend or oppress other people. Some people are willing to examine their privilege and actions in order to contribute to harmony. It’s not easy because we can be defensive. I guess I’m a far leftist when I say if it “entrenches on someone’s right to be here, then it’s bad.” The examples of cancel culture I hear the most about have to do with the statues of slave owners and rapists. But, apparently that’s morphing into other things as evidenced here. Btw being a so-called far leftist is where I feel decency lies. I find it weird that the pro-statue people have dragged it into the cancel culture domain, because I think that confuses the issue. Statues serve to celebrate individuals. Taking down statues doesn’t erase history, it ends the celebration. Burning/banning books is what tries to cancel history. I see. That makes sense. It apparently doesn’t take long for things to get muddied. I think muddied is pretty much the constant state of affairs. :/ Great post, Ashley! Yeah, this is a huge topic and I have mixed feelings about it. One thing is for sure, though, and cancel culture is exhausting. Both the right and left do it, too, and it seems like it’s more a tool for political power than anything else. That’s a good point. I had a couple columns published on cancel culture shortly after I first learned about it, in January 2020. https://spokanefavs.com/cancel-culture-isnt-new-but-its-still-dangerous/ https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/jan/20/faith-and-values-take-obamas-advice-and-dont-just-/ Cancel culture horror stories abound, but I have to say I have mixed feelings. As someone said above, I think it’s taken on broader meaning in the past year or more. It has the effect of making me want to effect more self-censorship — in order to avoid cancellation. That could be a good thing, if spread around. It’s a bizarre phenomenon. Given that banishing has been going probably since humans learned how to make fire, I wonder if cancel culture is an almost inevitable result of human nature plus social media. This was a really interesting read. ‘Cancel Culture’ is a phrase that gets thrown about a lot but without any real consideration as to what it means. Because isolating people from society for views you don’t agree with is not a new concept. I think cancelling people is an important option to have available to ensure a moral code for society that protects vulnerable groups but that it has gone too far. Also as a history uni graduate I am wary about judging those in history by modern standards. Looking back at history, some actions clearly caused direct harm to others, but many were more indirect, and just because we see those indirect linkages now doesn’t mean they were apparent then. Cancelling someone, in terms of public shaming, or shunning, or just being criticized, is, again, nothing new, though it is arguably different in how quickly and severely it can happen online.” That’s a very good point. If they are consistent purveyors and catalysts of hatred or violence, shame and shun away! Yes,, there’s really no room for that in the public arena. I’ve never understood cancel culture. From what my brain is telling me after reading your post, is it that of people acting upon something to which they find offensive? Or have I got the wrong end of the stick? Most likely the latter. Yeah, it seems to be people “cancelling” things they find offensive. Or maybe just Twitter hive brain. I’m really not clear. I’m just surprised my brain actually managed to process something which is current! 😄 Lol “Cancel culture” wasn’t a thing until boycott’s started being organized on social media and hitting conservatives. Suddenly, “cancel culture” is a thing and it’s bad. Most of the time, the word they’re looking for is “consequences.” There are absolutely problems with setting the mob that is social media lose on a specific target. People in groups are stupid and mean. But “cancel culture” didn’t bother conservatives when they were calling for boycott’s of Nike over #takeaknee. Boycotting isn’t new. The sudden amplifications about “cancel culture” mostly seems based in hypocrisy. At least, that’s my reading. Yeah, boycotting is not not at all. I guess social media just makes it possible on a new scale. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. See Privacy & Terms of Use. Copyright © 2025 Ashley L.

https://nypost.com/article/what-is-cancel-culture-breaking-down-the-toxic-online-trend/,31-August-2021,What is cancel culture? Everything to know about the toxic online trend,"Is it time to throw the #CancelCultureIsOverParty yet? “Jeopardy!” producer Mike Richards is among the latest of the cancellable celebrities, right after Chris Harrison stole the cancel culture show on “The Bachelor” earlier this year. Even Dr. Seuss and Eminem (sort of) have found themselves among the famous figures who were declared “over.” Meet the celebrity “casualties” of cancel culture 2021. The cancelation debate heated up last summer after Twitter users took to the digital platform to condemn Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling for making anti-trans comments along with denouncing singer-rapper Doja Cat’s racist chatroom past and former “Glee” star Lea Michele’s alleged mistreatment of co-stars. By July, the focus had lasered in on talk show host DeGeneres (complete with a death hoax) and “Killing Eve” star Jodie Comer’s rumored conservative boyfriend. The hits kept coming through the fall and haven’t stopped — even for beloved kids movies. Disney+ announced that they’d be putting a filter on old classics such as “Dumbo” and “The Aristocats” over racist imagery. A sequel to “Space Jam” will notably leave out the creepily persistent Pepe Le Pew. And Millennial parents are done with Dr. Seuss books after realizing the harmful stereotypes depicted in his books. But what does it really mean to get the #RIP treatment — and will society ever declare it to be over, too? Cancel culture — the phenomenon of promoting the “canceling” of people, brands and even shows and movies due to what some consider to be offensive or problematic remarks or ideologies — isn’t all that new. Dr. Jill McCorkel, a professor of sociology and criminology at Villanova University, told The Post that the roots of cancel culture have been present throughout human history. Societies have punished people for behaving outside of perceived social norms for centuries, she said, and this is just another variation. “Cancel culture is an extension of or a contemporary evolution of a much bolder set of social processes that we can see in the form of banishment,” she said. “[They] are designed to reinforce the set of norms.” Over the last few years, the social-media trend has gained momentum under the trendy new name — placing celebrities, companies and media alike under a microscope of political correctness. Here’s a brief rundown of what’s been canceled lately. What is: problematic. Richards was forced to step down from his role as “Jeopardy!” host after allegations surfaced that he was sexist and had reportedly harassed female employees. “We had hoped that when Mike stepped down from the host position at ‘Jeopardy!’ it would have minimized the disruption and internal difficulties we have all experienced these last few weeks. That clearly has not happened,” reps for the show said before announcing his exit. The controversial podcaster has been canceled time and time again for his conservative political beliefs and offensive comments. Most recently, he was canceled for his anti-vaccination comments. On an episode of his own podcast, Rogan complained that white men are “oppressed” because his opinions are seen as offensive or politically incorrect. Children under 7 will now be forbidden from watching “Dumbo,” “Peter Pan” “Swiss Family Robinson” and the “The Aristocats.” Settings on the app will prevent the movies from even showing up on the young viewers’ profiles. Disney explained its rationale behind each film’s removal on the kid-focused Stories Matter section of their website. They cited “Dumbo’s” (1941) infamous singing crows, which “pay homage to racist minstrel shows, where white performers with blackened faces and tattered clothing imitated and ridiculed enslaved Africans on Southern plantations.” Last month, the TV personality lost yet another on-air gig with “Good Morning Britain,” a decision that came seven years after he was originally canceled in 2014, along with his show on CNN. The controversial host confirmed that he left “GMB” because he refused to apologize for disbelieving Meghan Markle’s claims of suicidal ideation as a royal. In a letter to his fans posted on Instagram, Morgan wrote: “This is not simply an act of defiance, but a commitment to our collective futures.” The once irreproachable children’s book author has been the subject of racial reckoning. On March 2 — what would have been the late author and illustrator’s 117th birthday — the company that oversees Seuss’ publications announced that they were pulling licensing rights to six titles, due to racially insensitive depictions of Asian and Black characters. These books — which include “And To Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street” and “Scrambled Eggs Super!” -— “portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,” Dr. Seuss Enterprises said in a statement to the Associated Press. She’s no stranger to controversy. The infamous author has been canceled multiple times over the years, specifically for negative comments about people identifying as transgender. Earlier this year, a Harry Potter-themed segment at a book festival was canceled due to Rowling’s insensitive remarks online, the latest in her cancel culture controversy. This one may be an example of cancel culture turning on itself. Gen Zers were schooled by Millennials after they attempted to cancel the rapper over his angst-filled lyrics. The controversy kicked off in February when a “zoomer” (or Gen Z member) posted a TikTok clip condemning the rapper’s 2010 hit “Love the Way You Lie,” featuring Rihanna, for reportedly glorifying violence against women. They highlighted the verse “If she ever tries to f–king leave again I’ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire.” The hater’s on-camera diss caused 30-somethings to — in the words of an Eminem song title — “just lose it,” as many of them grew up on the 48-year-old Detroit native’s tunes. One inspired TikTok sketch depicts an Eminem-loving millennial having a mock argument with himself as a Gen Zer, who says, “We gotta cancel Eminem.” The millennial responds, “Why?” and is then asked by his offended younger doppelgänger, “Have you heard his lyrics?” The creator, back to playing his millennial Fireball-drinking self, responds: “Heard ’em? I was raised screaming them all through grade school.” The serial harasser Pepé Le Pew was canceled from “Space Jam 2.” Producers decided to cut one of Pepé‘s star scenes in the sequel, in which the character is depicted as a flirty bartender who insists on kissing a female customer (played by Greice Santo) despite her many objections. According to Deadline, the scene also sees pro baller James take Pepé aside to explain the concept of “consent” as the flirtatious skunk admits that his longtime love, Penelope Pussycat, had filed for a restraining order against him — a troubling statement to come from a children’s cartoon. Carano, 38, who played bounty hunter Cara Dune in the first two seasons of “The Mandalorian,” was fired from the show for her controversial social media posts. Lucasfilm made no secret of why she was canceled, ripping “her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities,” which it called “abhorrent and unacceptable.” Carano’s most controversial message — and the one that appears to have been the final straw — came when she shared an image from Nazi Germany and compared it to today’s overheated political climate. “Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors…. even by children,” her post stated. This popular request amongst the platform’s users actively encourages a person to be put under the microscope. Twitter’s users are often known for their FBI-like investigative skills — digging up past dirt, old secrets and discovering people’s identities — and are now being utilized in the resurgence of cancel culture. Users are uncovering the identities of people expressing racist comments in viral videos, with one recent victim being Amy Cooper, 41, otherwise known as “Central Park Karen.” The video featured the white woman calling the police on a black man, Christian Cooper (no relation), 57, who requested her dog be put on a leash. “Karen” promptly told authorities an “African-American man is threatening my life,” all whilst seemingly strangling her dog. After the video racked up millions of views, she was fired from her investment firm job, temporarily forced to surrender her dog and charged with one count of falsely reporting an incident in the third degree. The viral clip also spawned new hate crimes legislation. Celebrities are joining the cancel-culture call to action, too. Actress-writer Skai Jackson, 18, took to Twitter last month to expose a high-school student featured in a viral video screaming racial slurs. She identified his name, prospective college and Instagram handle. In the thread, her followers used it as an opportunity to expose other people’s offensive posts, starting a chain of ultimate Twitter investigative work in the name of canceling racists. Pop singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, 35, experienced similar backlash after making comments about fellow female recording artists — many of them women of color. The collective canceling of someone, even on the internet, creates a sense of solidarity, McCorkel explained, and reinforces the feeling of togetherness, that “we are a group…and we don’t tolerate that kind of behavior.” “It reinforces, at a time of political division, a sense of shared solidarity, at least among the people who are doing the canceling,” she said. “It’s psychologically intoxicating to feel part of a group and to feel a part of something larger than yourself.” Popular Twitter accounts like @YesYoureRacist and @RacistOTW have become the pop-culture racism watchdogs. They’ve made it their civic duty to scrutinize the actions of average people and public figures alike, shedding light on previously overlooked or unknown incidents. Cancel culture, though, isn’t exclusive to celebrities. Companies and brands are under fire for racist imagery. After facing backlash for perpetuating racist stereotypes, the 130-year-old Aunt Jemima breakfast brand is getting a makeover. Similarly, Uncle Ben’s and Mrs. Butterworth’s brands might be next. Popular vegan recipe creator, formerly named “Thug Kitchen,” also underwent a rebrand, revealing its new name as “Bad Manners” last month. Eskimo Pies, owned by Dreyer’s, and Cream of Wheat also followed suit. Sports teams began to jump on board, too. After years of criticism, the Washington Redskins are finally brainstorming a new team name, inspiring the Cleveland Indians to consider doing the same. With cancel culture comes apologies for the actions that caused the cancellation in the first place. The #IsOverParty is an ode to cancel culture, most recently used to cancel Jimmy Fallon after a video resurfaced of him in blackface imitating Chris Rock. While #JimmyFallonIsOverParty was quick to trend on Twitter, some users were quick to condemn his cancellation. “The culture of canceling people is ridiculous. Jimmy Fallon did this 20 years ago when he was young and had to listen to his boss in order to put food on his table,” wrote one user in the thread. The 45-year-old talk show host has since apologized, writing on Twitter that it was a “terrible decision” to wear blackface, that he is “very sorry” and thanked his fans for holding him accountable for his actions, despite how long ago it was. McCorkel acknowledged that we are quick to cancel and not so quick to forgive or believe that people can learn from mistakes, but as someone who has extensive knowledge of the criminal justice system, she has been witness to people changing. “I know that people are capable of rehabilitation,” she said, adding that she’s seen it happen and that people can grow if given the chance. Twitter’s ability to dredge up old, problematic content is creating new problems for other celebrities, too. YouTubers Jenna Marbles, whose real name is Jenna Mourey, and Shane Dawson recently faced criticism for donning blackface on their channels years ago. Mourey even decided to call it quits over the incident. As Americans realize the racist history of the US, many holidays, monuments and traditions have come under fire and subsequently been “canceled.” Columbus Day — to commemorate the arrival of Christopher Columbus in America— is not exempt. Now in many states, the day is instead “Indigenous Peoples Day,” to remember the genocide of native people on the land settlers colonized. But not everyone is thrilled about the change. Those who are adamant about tradition and keeping even the ugly parts of our history see the cancellation of Columbus as a complete erasure of our country’s foundations. This week, Harper’s Magazine published an open letter calling to do away with cancel culture altogether, denouncing the movement as “censorious” and “an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty.” Many Twitter users responded to the open letter — which was signed by more than 150 public figures, including Margaret Atwood, 80, and Rowling, 54 — in disgust, arguing that bigotry, like they believe many of the signers are guilty of, is not free speech. Eugene Gu, the CEO of CoolQuit.com with almost 500,000 followers on Twitter, responded to the letter in a tweet, saying, that while he believes in free speech, “Many of the signatories on this letter…believe in free speech for themselves and horrible consequences for those who disagree with them.” In a subsequent tweet, the 34-year-old added that racism, sexism and homophobia are not free speech, because it is discriminatory to others. “This rigidity right now in American political discourse is problematic because you really can’t have a high-functioning democracy without people being willing to engage one another in meaningful ways to hash out their political disagreements,” she said. She acknowledged that while it depends greatly on the issue at hand, there’s a difference between canceling a type of behavior that is collectively agreed on as “bad” — using #MeToo and condemning workplace sexual harassment, for example — and canceling one particular person without discourse. “We have to be able to come together across those political differences and sort out what are the optimal solutions,” she said. “We can’t do that if we are dug into our respective trenches and unwilling to engage across those political divides.” Advertisement",time throw cancelcultureisoverparti

https://axis.org/blog/an-introduction-to-cancel-culture/,24-July-2020,What is Cancel Culture?,"By Axis Each of us can probably recall an embarrassing “caught” moment. Whether it was more innocent—like taking a cookie without permission as a kid—or more serious—like cheating on a test or a significant other—we all have moments when we go against our better judgment and, when caught, immediately feel foolish. In many of these cases, the consequences and repercussions of those actions remain a personal issue that we can learn and move on from without permanently damaging our reputations. But what if you’re a celebrity? In our social-media-driven world, it’s easier than ever to find the tea about prominent figures. As more and more stories come out about questionable actions from celebrities and influencers, people are becoming quicker to judge and “canceling” those who have made questionable statements or actions. In some cases it can provide much-needed accountability, but for many others it has become an example of forgetting grace and eliminating one’s chance to learn from their mistakes. Gen Z is growing up in a cancel culture, and it’s important for us as parents and caring adults to know what it is and how it’s impacting them. The term “canceled” means to delete something or someone out of your life. As the instances of public “canceling” have increased over the past few years, it’s become its own culture. While you can cancel just about anyone or anything you want, “cancel culture” has become the mass-movement of revoking privileges, taking away platforms, and trying to blacklist celebrities and powerful figures—sometimes for something that happened decades prior. Cancel culture generally happens on (but is not limited to) apps like TikTok and Twitter, and spreads through user-created hashtags, usually following a #___isover format (some recent hashtags include #lanadelreyisover and #jimmyfallonisover). Reasons for why someone is considered “over” vary, but for the ones mentioned, Lana Del Rey was accused of being racist in a post about how she feels her music is wrongfully criticized, and Jimmy Fallon was accused of being racist when a video of him using blackface on SNL 20 years ago resurfaced. Racism, homophobia, sexism, sexual misconduct, and overall frowned upon behavior can all be triggers for cancel culture. The term “cancel” first originated from a line in the ‘90s movie New Jack City, but didn’t begin to take off until the 2010s. After a 2014 episode of Love and Hip-Hop: New York aired in which one character breaks up with his girlfriend by saying “you’re canceled,” the phrase began to take off on Black Twitter. It eventually made its way into mainstream culture, moving from a phrase you would use around your friends in a funny way to a phrase you would use to promote boycotting a celebrity whose actions you disagreed with. One of the most notable springboards of cancel culture is the #MeToo movement, where canceling has been used to call out actual crimes committed by powerful figures. In some cases like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein, there were factual, verifiable allegations that led to cancelation. With other proven-true cases like Aziz Ansari and Louis C.K., their careers were certainly tainted after allegations, but have since resumed as they were before. However, other cases weren’t so cut-and-dry. Allegations of sexual assault against Cole Sprouse and Justin Bieber were actually found to be entirely false, making the cancelations misinformed and unnecessary. The #MeToo movement is only a fraction of cancel stories. Cancel culture has grown substantially and will more than likely continue to do so. Nowadays, it’s all too common for a celebrity to be canceled for something they said or did, even if that action occurred years prior. Of course, we do not condone inappropriate language or behavior, but we do question the idea of canceling someone without room for grace, listening, or forgiveness of any kind. One problem with cancel culture is that it’s just as fleeting as the regular news cycle. A celebrity can be canceled one day, forgiven and forgotten about the next. Stars like Kanye West, Jeffree Star, and Camila Cabello have all been canceled before, yet fans continue to support them as if nothing happened. In many cases, a quick apology post or video is enough for once-enraged people to move on and forget about someone’s cancelation altogether. This quick-fix is worth questioning: Do people participate in cancel culture as a way to fit in with their peers, or are their opinions and reasons for canceling someone legitimate? Though many have been forgiven and forgotten, no public figure is safe from cancel culture. Whether it’s re-interpreting something a celebrity says, or deep-diving to find something controversial, cancel culture invades privacy with the intent to harm an individual rather than raise awareness for an issue. Gen Z relies on social media to be in-the-know about their world, so it’s natural to assume that they’re usually aware of whoever has been canceled on a daily basis. They’re passionate about social justice and activism, and quick to rally together to use their voices against things they disagree with. However, along with this, teens’ brains have not fully developed yet, meaning their wisdom and discernment have yet to fully mature. With the consistent outpour of cancelations, Gen Z may wonder who and what to believe, and be quicker to judge a celebrity based on what their peers say rather than what the facts say. In an effort to feel included, teens may rely on what social media says when they form their own opinions. While it’s important to talk to your teens about the repercussions of discrimination and misconduct, it’s equally important to make them aware of the repercussions of posting things on social media for anyone to see, as well as how to navigate showing grace to those who have.

A decade into the culture wars, his case proves what should have been clear all along Pinned to the top of JK Rowling’s X page, where the author has more than 14 million followers and posts frequently about her gender-critical views, is a tweet that contains a screenshot of the kind of message she is often sent. The screenshot reads: “You are a stupid and horrible woman. My kids and I enjoyed burning your books and roasting marshmallows over your pathetic books.” And in the tweet, in September 2024, Rowling responded: “I get the same royalties whether you burn them or read them. Enjoy your marshmallows!” Somewhat ironically, given Rowling is often at the centre of conversations about unfair pile-ons by the right-on mob, this perfectly summarises “cancel culture”. Her point is that no matter how much vitriol is directed your way, no matter how many of your books are burnt or films boycotted, if you are powerful and famous enough your “cancellation” is rarely equivalent to actual, material censorship but rather the lesser punishment of factional unpopularity. In other words, your career won’t actually suffer, even if some people think you’re “stupid and horrible”. It’s tempting, therefore, to wonder whether cancel culture really exists. For example, it was recently announced that Johnny Depp would be starring in a new film, Day Drinker, an action-thriller by the Spider-Man director Marc Webb, co-starring Penelope Cruz, just over two years after he settled his libel case – at the appeal stage following a US jury ruling largely in his favour – against his ex-wife Amber Heard, who had written in an op-ed for the Washington Post that she was a domestic abuse survivor. Two years earlier, Depp lost another libel case in the UK against The Sun, which had called him a “wife-beater” in a headline – a claim that the judged ruled was “substantially true”. Depp told The Sunday Times in 2021 that he was being “boycotted by Hollywood” as a result (he resigned from the Fantastic Beasts film franchise, at Warner Bros’ request, when he lost the UK case). If that were true, you could see why, but if the powers that be once cancelled him, they have now firmly pressed Ctrl-Z. He renewed a $20m (£15m) contract with Dior in May 2023, and his face was soon six-foot high on billboards around the world. He had a leading role in the widely panned French historical drama Jeanne du Barry (2023), in which he was perceived to be cast purely for the sake of controversy. As well as his upcoming role in Day Drinker, he is rumoured to be in conversations about reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean 6. And despite being ousted from the cast of Fantastic Beasts, he still got paid his $16m (£12m) salary. Like Rowling, it seems, the damage being “cancelled” has done to Depp is mainly that a lot of people don’t like him. One of the main problems with cancel culture is that, unlike the law, its punishment is the same for every crime. A celebrity or politician does or says the wrong thing and they are ritually sacrificed by the masses as a representation of all that is Bad, before they gradually re-emerge. But it’s easy to ridicule when the levels of Bad are so different. Adele was, for a time, “cancelled” because she wore a Jamaican flag bikini and Bantu knots in her hair for Notting Hill carnival, but equally Michael Jackson is cancelled because he – allegedly – systematically groomed and molested several children. Lena Dunham was cancelled for making a flippant comment about abortion; Kanye West is cancelled because he is a raging anti-Semite. But Depp’s case – thorny as it was – tells us a lot about what cancel culture actually is. The key is that cancellation is subjective. Whether or not you are cancelled is in the eye of the beholder – it simply cannot be true that if you continue to support a celebrity (whether that’s through watching their films or rampantly defending them online) you are partaking in their cancellation. In a New York Times essay on the subject in 2020, Ligaya Mishan pointed out that “to cancel” is a consumer verb, one that usually involves a commodity or a transaction. You cancel an order, you cancel a subscription, a studio cancels a failing TV show. Cancel culture is about politics, yes, but it’s also about a capitalist society that conflates people with products and where individual choice is sanctified beyond question. Perhaps this is part of what is so disarming about getting cancelled – suddenly you are being treated like a product, service or event, rather than a person. This in turn is inextricable from social media, which has democratised everything and turned relationships into transactions, but which also unprecedently amplifies the voices of individuals. To put all this simply: if enough people decide they no longer like Johnny Depp and would like to unsubscribe from his output, forever, he is less likely to get work. If the tide turns, he gets work again. Of course, cancel culture is also inextricable from “wokeism”. For similarly complex reasons this is the age of the pile-on, of extremism, tribalism, black and white thinking. People are good or bad, right or wrong. At what was arguably the peak of this era, in 2020, a group of writers published an open letter in Harper’s magazine expressing their concerns about the increasing restriction of “the free exchange of information and ideas”. Rowling signed it; so did many other notable and respected writers, like Martin Amis, Noam Chomsky, Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie. The climate of fear about being seen to say or do the wrong thing is real, and felt particularly real at the point that it felt like society was being restructured by the myriad progressive movements that had reached or were close to reaching their peak (among them MeToo and Black Lives Matter, but also body positivity and trans rights). But the idea of “cancel culture” was itself creating division: its constant invocation meant that you couldn’t even reasonably try to cancel anyone for fear of being called a snowflake. Between 2018 and 2021, the use of the phrase in UK newspapers increased from six to 3,670 per year (23 per cent of those usages were by the Daily Mail) – and the weaponisation of the term has been highly effective. You’re now more likely to hear liberal millennials ironically worrying about “getting cancelled” over totally innocuous thoughts and feelings than you are to hear them trying to cancel anyone else. My own personal favourite is a phrase, stolen shamelessly from the American comedy podcast Seek Treatment, which serves as a wonderfully hyperbolic substitute for the old classic “no offence”: “Cancel me straight to hell, but…”. * Depp’s second libel case, in the US, was particularly remarkable because it was livestreamed and extensively raked over on social media. Though Depp was the one being described as abusive, it was Heard – whom Depp was accusing of lying – who was tried in the court of public opinion. The internet fizzed with hatred for her and accused her of making it all up. But Heard was the underdog (because Depp is much more famous than her, and because of the simple fact that she is a woman) – and you can’t cancel the underdog. This, of course, is the heart of the issue. Oppressed, marginalised and minority groups often feel they cannot rely on systems – legal, political or corporate – to look after them. Justice has to be sought elsewhere. People complain of the liberal elite and woke rule, but the reality is that cancel culture is, in essence, a positively anarchic way to root out the “bad guys” in a world that always seems to let them win. Kevin Spacey, for example, was cleared in 2023 of nine sexual offences, including charges brought by fellow actor Anthony Rapp. But Spacey, who has not had a prominent film or TV role since, is one of the only feasible examples of a “successful” cancelling. It has “worked”, for him, perhaps in part because he is still awaiting trial for other charges but maybe also because (unlike Depp) Spacey wasn’t famous enough to have the sort of loyal fanbase who would support him unconditionally, so it’s unsurprising studios have since chosen not to take the risk. In virtually every case, “cancellations” are instigated by people who feel such work should be done by the system – and if the person in question is not brought down, the work continues. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the case of the eminently uncancellable Rowling, who has been instrumental in the prominence of the recent Supreme Court ruling on what defines a woman. When justice is seen to be done – such as in the case of the R&B singer R Kelly, who is now serving a 31-year prison term for sex crimes against children – there is no need to cancel him, no fight left to fight. His music is still available, but nobody feels much like listening to it. Which brings us back to Depp. Although the first libel case was conclusive in The Sun’s favour, Depp hasn’t actually been convicted of a crime. So at what point do filmmakers, brands, friends and the public have a duty to unsubscribe from someone? Who is looking after us if we don’t trust the system? Does Depp’s appearance in Day Drinker and in Dior adverts send a message beyond the cynical: that plenty of people still buy into him as an actor, as a celebrity? I think it probably does. But I’m only one person – and if we’ve learnt anything over the past 10 years, it’s that not all people’s views are created equal.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2020/09/13/cancel-culture-is-only-getting-worse/,13-September-2020,Cancel Culture Is Only Getting Worse,"ByEvan Gerstmann ByEvan Gerstmann, Former Contributor. Cancel culture symbol or cultural cancellation and social media censorship as canceling or ... More restricting opinions that are offensive or controversial to the public with 3D illustration elements. There is no single accepted definition of cancel culture, but at its worst, it is about unaccountable groups successfully applying pressure to punish someone for perceived wrong opinions. The victim ends up losing their job or is significantly harmed in some way well beyond the discomfort of merely being disagreed with. Someone like J.K. Rowling isn’t really a victim of cancel culture—she’s too rich to be punished in any meaningful way and she doesn’t have the kind of job that one can be fired from. Powerful voices on the institutional left claim that there is no such thing as cancel culture. For example, the New York Times columnist Charles Blow, tweets: “Once more THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CANCEL CULTURE. There is free speech. You can say and do as pls, and others can choose never to deal this [sic] you, your company or your products EVER again. The rich and powerful are just upset that the masses can now organize their dissent.” This argument confuses dissent with punishment. The victims of cancel culture are generally not powerful people. They are often vulnerable people who suffer devastating harm. A previous post discussed an African American school security guard who was fired for using the N-word in the course of telling a student not to direct that word at him. (Thankfully, he was eventually re-hired after a national furor erupted.) The same post discussed a teacher who was fired for inadvertently failing to address a student by his self-identified gender pronoun. The security guard and the teacher each have four children to support and lost their health insurance as well as their income when they were fired. They are hardly examples of the rich and powerful. But at least one can say the security guard actually used the n-word and the teacher actually did have a religious objection to recognizing transgender identities. But as people, especially in educational settings, have grown more intimidated, it has been harder for the cancel culture warriors to find such people. So instead of finding someone who actually used the n-word, they expand the definition of cancel-worthy language. A professor at the University of Southern California was placed on leave for using a Chinese word that some people think sounds like the n-word even though it is simply the Chinese word for “that.” The professor is a member of USC US-China Institute, and was teaching a communications course and was using the word to illustrate how different languages use different words to fill in pauses. The situation has deteriorated to the point that one no longer needs to say anything to be targeted by cancel culture. At Skidmore College in New York State, a professor is being boycotted for merely attending a pro-police “Back the Blue” rally. He didn’t participate in any way, he didn’t speak or shout slogans, or carry a sign. He says he just wanted to hear what the demonstrators had to say. But an email circulated at the college saying, ""Tonight, I and other Skidmore students witnessed Profs. David Peterson and Andrea Peterson at an anti-Black Lives Matter protest. We demand the immediate dismissal of both Skidmore staff members for engaging in hateful conduct that threatens Black Skidmore students."" (It turned out that Andrea Peterson doesn’t work at the college.) The professor found a notice on his classroom door saying “STOP. By entering this class you are crossing a campus-wide picket line and breaking the boycott against Professor David Peterson. This is not a safe environment for marginalized students . . . By continuing to take this course you are enabling bigoted behavior on this campus."" According to Professor Peterson, as a result of the boycott, he has no remaining students in one class and only a very small number of students in his other two classes. He also says the university is investigating him for possible bias. This extravagant expansion of cancel-worthy behavior is not limited to academia and it is not limited to anything a person has said or done anytime this century. A top executive at Boeing recently lost his job because of an article he wrote in 1987, opposing allowing women to serve as fighter pilots. The executive apologized for the article, writing: “My article was a 29-year-old Cold War navy pilot’s misguided contribution to a debate that was live at the time. The dialogue that followed its publication 33 years ago quickly opened my eyes, indelibly changed my mind, and shaped the principles of fairness, inclusion, respect and diversity that have guided my professional life since.” That was not enough to save his job. In no way is contemporary cancel culture about free speech or debate. Nor is it any longer primarily about social justice. The power to get someone fired must be a thrilling feeling. It also strengthens group bonds and can raise one’s social standing in certain groups. It is not hard to understand why many people would be willing to look further and further afield to find targets: an innocently uttered Chinese word for “that,” mere attendance at a rally to hear a point of view, or a 33-year-old article that the author has renounced and apologized for. What is harder to understand is why the truly powerful, those with the power to suspend and investigate professors and to fire people, are allowing this? Perhaps they fear becoming targets themselves. Whatever the reason, there is no denying that cancel culture exists and is getting worse.",byevan gerstmann byevan gerstmann contributor cancel cultur symbol cultur cancel social medium censorship cancel restrict opinion offens controversi public illustr element singl accept definit cancel cultur bad unaccount successfulli appli pressur punish perceiv wrong opinion victim lose job significantli harm discomfort disagre rowl isn victim cancel cultur rich punish meaning doesn job fire power voic institut leav claim cancel cultur york time columnist charl blow tweet cancel cultur free speech pl choos deal sic compani product rich power upset mass organ dissent argument confus dissent punish victim cancel cultur power peopl vulner peopl suffer devast harm previou post discuss african american school secur guard fire word tell student direct word thankfulli eventu hire nation furor erupt post discuss teacher fire inadvert fail address student identifi gender pronoun secur guard teacher child support lose health insur incom fire exampl rich power secur guard word teacher religi object recogn transgend ident peopl educ set grow intimid hard cancel cultur warrior peopl find word tongu stick definit cancel worthi languag professor univers southern california leav chines word peopl sound word simpli chines word professor usc china institut teach commun word illustr languag word fill paus situat deterior target cancel cultur skidmor colleg york professor boycott attend pro polic blue ralli didn particip didn speak shout slogan carri sign hear demonstr email circul colleg tonight skidmor student wit prof david peterson andrea peterson anti black life matter protest demand dismiss skidmor staff engag hate conduct threaten black skidmor student andrea peterson doesn colleg professor find notic classroom door stop enter class cross campu wide picket line break boycott professor david peterson safe environ margin student continu enabl bigot behavior campu professor peterson result boycott remain student class student class univers investig bia extravag tongu stick ansion cancel worthi behavior limit academia limit person anytim centuri top execut boe recent lose job articl write oppos allow woman serv fighter pilot execut apolog articl write articl cold war navi pilot misguid contribut debat live time dialogu public ago quickli ey indelibli chang mind shape principl fair inclus respect divers guid profession life save job contemporari cancel cultur free speech debat primarili social justic power fire thrill feel strengthen bond rais social stand hard understand peopl afield target innoc utter chines word mere attend ralli hear view articl author renounc apolog hard understand power power suspend investig professor fire peopl allow fear target reason deni cancel cultur exist bad,59,6,0.15365079365079365,0.14253968253968252,0.12476190476190477,0.16253968253968254,0.033650793650793646,0.28476190476190477,0.0980952380952381,59,Cultural Sanctions & Cancel Justice

The 32-year-old pop star insisted that these days it is not possible to be in the public eye in her position and not speak out on certain political situations, but she knows that she won't always ""get it right"" and there will be ""consequences"" to that. She said: ""Cancel culture is thriving now. When you’re in the public eye, it’s quite scary. I’ve always been quite vocal, and I’m not always going to get it right. ""But you can’t be a pop artist right now without speaking out about certain things. "" I have been warned there could be consequences for speaking out about things like Palestine, but these are basic human rights. We’re seeing an attack on the trans community, and I have a very big LGBTQ+ fanbase, I can’t sit back and not be vocal about defending that community. I’m happy to pay the consequences if it means doing the right thing."" The 'It Girl' hitmaker - who shot to fame as part of Little Mix alongside Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jesy Nelson - added that she has a voice in her head which she likened to a homosexual man whom she regards as a guide in life. She said: ""I definitely have an inner voice, which I feel like is a gay man telling me how to navigate life and if I look good. Little Jade is in there too and is guiding me. If I’m anxious or overthinking things, I imagine how she’d feel about where I am now. ""There is [a negative voice] and it’s all about [social media]. It’s definitely about putting my phone down and coming off Twitter [X]. I never go on apps like that and come off them feeling good about myself. I’ve had to grow a thick skin in this industry – people are constantly talking about me and how I look or what the music’s like.

I’ve got opinions, not that I’d go online and say them…"" South Sydney have returned to the NRL's top eight with a 22-12 win over Wests Tigers, with their form under Wayne Bennett defying the club's casualty ward. Payne Haas is set to undergo a vital scan that will decide if he plays in State of Origin I while Mitch Moses and Dylan Edwards have won selection in key roles. Gold Coast forward Beau Fermor will debut for Queensland after winger Murray Taulagi (calf) was ruled out of Origin I and Selwyn Cobbo (wrist) also went down. Jarome Luai has refused to suggest he was hard done by in being dropped from NSW's State of Origin side for game one, conceding he must 'own' his form in 2025. A minute's silence has been held before West Coast's AFL clash with St Kilda to pay tribute to Adam Selwood, who died on Saturday. West Coast have posted their first win under coach Andrew McQualter, overcoming a five-goal haul from Jack Higgins to post a 28-point victory over St Kilda. Melbourne Victory will attempt to convince star players to stay on and chase silverware after suffering a heartbreaking A-League Women grand final defeat. Former Chiefs flyhalf Bryn Gatland created two of his side's four tries to help steer the Kobe Steelers into the Japan Rugby League One semi-finals. Central Coast have won their first A-League Women championship after scoring an upset win on penalties over Melbourne Victory in the grand final. Portugal has endured a decade of fragile governments - a situation unlikely to change as millions vote in a third parliamentary poll in as many years. Rock-solid defence and a brilliant attacking display from fullback Kaeo Weekes helped the Raiders to a 40-24 blitz of the hapless Titans. Clayton Oliver found form as Melbourne came from 24 points behind to shock Brisbane in an 11-point Gabba win that left the Lions with work to do. Bree Rizzo has beaten American star Sha'Carri Richardson to win the 100m, headlining a brace of strong Australian results at a Tokyo athletics grand prix. The Sunshine Coast Lightning have locked in second spot on the Super Netball ladder with a commanding win over the Melbourne Vixens. Poles are voting in the first round of a presidential election that pits a pro-EU candidate against one of US President Donald Trump's admirers. Cam Zurhaar overcame a foot injury to kick four crucial goals as North Melbourne beat Richmond by four points to secure their first MCG triumph in eight years. St George Illawarra have beaten Brisbane 30-26 in an incredible comeback win, with Clint Gutherson shining and Ezra Mam outstanding on his NRL return. Romania is holding a presidential election run-off after the first round of voting triggered the collapse of a pro-Western coalition government. Almost half of children experienced physical abuse before entering out-of-home care in one state, prompting a landmark inquiry into the ""broken"" system.

DiscussionTrader Joe’s Lost at Sea : Cancelled and Banned! (self.CancelCulture) submitted 1 year ago by Frozeawake It is my hope that the time taken to record these events, and the time taken to read and discuss them, will benefit our society. It should be clear that our society is troubled on many levels, and this is an attempt to add clarity, so that we may together begin to resolve, at least, a few of them. There were two events occurring a week apart. This was written a day after the most recent. A little background: My home has been in a larger city in the upper Midwest for the past decade. Over the past six decades, I have lived in several regions of this nation, including both coasts, as well as overseas. I have experienced many cultures and subcultures. It is not clear whether it is ‘the times’, my particular situation, or this community; but, this has been the least warm and welcoming community that I have experienced. The recent events exemplify this observation. Trader Joe’s opened a store here, a few years after I settled. I had often shopped at Trader Joe’s in my previous communities, and enjoy many of their offerings. It was great to see them here. At this point, I have been shopping at this store for many years. Because I have an engaging personality, I have developed several casual friendships with employees of this store. When I visit, and they are working, I make an effort to chat them up, and inquire about how they’re doing. Before we get to the details, it is important to provide a little context: I am in my sixties, stand at 6’ 7” (2m) tall, and am still competitive in sports. I’ve been an athlete my entire life. I have an engineering degree from a top ten engineering school. I have worked in numerous industries, and in many roles. I have been published. I have traveled. Most importantly, perhaps, I garden. In short, I am knowledgeable and experienced. One last point of context, important for this retelling, I am heterosexual. The first event: while pushing my cart in a very busy Trader Joe’s, searching for one of my favorites - and not finding it - I reached the end of the open freezer and raised my head, only to be surprised by a female face at eye level! Of course, she was on a ladder. She was stocking the higher freezer in the middle of the aisle. I said, making a small joke about my height, and having a question about my missing favorite, “This is perfect.” She gave me an angry look, and responded, “Dude, that’s inappropriate!” I was astonished and befuddled. She stepped off her ladder and disappeared. Hoping to assuage her surprising distress, I immediately sought out my most trusted acquaintance at Trader Joe’s, who happens to be the manager. I explained what happened, and asked him to assure her that I meant no offense. I had not seen her before, so I thought she might be new and inexperienced, and perhaps overwhelmed. We chatted a bit, I checked out, and left. The second event: A week later I was again shopping at Trader Joe’s. As I was approaching check out, I saw my manager friend, and we began to chat. He helped with the bagging so we could continue our chat. Or, so I thought. After my bags were loaded, we continued to chat, and he followed me out the door. This was strange. Then, I noticed that his colleague (another gentleman with whom I had conversed many times) had joined us. Until that moment, I had forgotten about the prior event. Then, my manager friend reminded me. He told me that I was no longer welcome to shop at Trader Joe’s because I had made an employee “uncomfortable”. Summarily. I found myself astounded and befuddled once again. I explained to him again my perspective (pun intended) of the prior event. He repeated his summary ban. I departed angrily. Initially, I was more disturbed by his intransigence and perceived betrayal than anything else. However, after a long bike ride, a conversation with a valued and enlightening friend, and several hours of reflection, I understood that the problems of my manager friend are far greater than mine. I have now only an inconvenience. I am in no danger. He could lose his position to the whims of an unsteady and disgruntled employee. I had once hired a person who interviewed with us wonderfully, but who later emerged to sew dissent amongst the team we were building. I understand his plight. His plight is made worse because this situation involves a woman. Whether her misinterpretation of the event is honest, or not, a danger is present. As it appears, she will likely suffer no consequences. If she does not, she will learn nothing, may be encouraged to continue, or even to escalate if her intentions are not honest. This is a failure not only of Trader Joe’s corporate culture, but primarily, and critically, of our greater culture. If parents are prevented from performing honorably in their professional roles, then they have failed in their familial role. They are increasing the likelihood that their children may someday suffer a similar misfortune. I encourage people of all genders to work together to communicate and to resolve this problem quickly. There are greater challenges we must face together. Post a comment! [–]davidhk21010 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (5 children) Maybe I'm missing something, but this paragraph is very ambiguous: The first event: while pushing my cart in a very busy Trader Joe’s, searching for one of my favorites - and not finding it - I reached the end of the open freezer and raised my head, only to be surprised by a female face at eye level!

I said, making a small joke about my height, and having a question about my missing favorite, “This is perfect.” She gave me an angry look, and responded, “Dude, that’s inappropriate!” I was astonished and befuddled. She stepped off her ladder and disappeared. Would you please be more detailed about what was actually said and to whom? [–]Frozeawake[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (4 children) I said, ""This is perfect"", to the woman employee on the step ladder. I had a question about a product, and she was a few feet away and at my eye level. That's something I do not often experience. The store was a very busy, we were surrounded by a dozen people and, at my height, I would imagine she would better be able to hear me. Her reaction was astonishing. I didn't know what to think. That is why I immediately went to talk with the manager. [–]davidhk21010 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (2 children) This makes absolutely no sense. If what you're saying is verbatim, you should call someone higher up in the management. There is nothing offensive about that statement. [–]Frozeawake[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (1 child) Someone soon will be speaking with Trader Joe's. After all, there were a dozen witnesses. The more disconcerting behavior was during the second event when the manager told me, ""You need to be sensitive to people's feelings."" He didn't even witness the exchange with the employee. I am always respectful. Even, when suffering condescension. It was almost as if he was attempting to antagonize. I just ended the conversation and walked away after that foolish comment. This manager wasn't even born when I had my first management responsibilities. [–]Lady_in_the_red-58 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago* (0 children) I’m not even sure what she was insinuating that you meant unless maybe she felt because you were looking into her eyes you were coming on to her? What DID you mean? It is a bit of an uncomfortable statement to say to a woman “this is perfect” while looking into her eyes. A woah, you surprised me. I’m not used to someone being at eye level might have been received better. [–]Valuable_Campaign676 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago (0 children) Here’s my theory. She thought you were talking about looking up her skirt. But since people there don’t wear skirts often; this seems unlikely. [–]thisaccountbeanony 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (4 children) What did you say? [–]Frozeawake[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (3 children) I said only three words to the woman employee, ""This is perfect."" She immediately replied, ""Dude, that's inappropriate."", stepped off the ladder and left me standing astonished in the aisle. [–]overlockk 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (1 child) He was totally at boob level with a woman who was well endowed. Cancel culture sucks but stop talking to breasts. I’m so torn by this. If you didn’t talk to her boobs she would have helped you. If I’m completely wrong I am sorry. If I’m spot on then please don’t do this in the future. [–]Frozeawake[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (0 children) Sorry, even though she was on a step ladder, I was still taller. We were about the same eye level. [–]dpsuperduper 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago (0 children) I had a similar experience at Trader Joe's in San Diego. I'm 67 male and I knew two managers Erik and Mike and I got banned in March 2024 and I've been shopping there since 2015 when the store 1st opened. I was friendly with many people at TJ's and my neighbor works there for 31 years. No one wants to understand my side of the story and you are automatically judged as doing something wrong which is what's happening in this discussion . People are very judgmental and not acting like a Christian and that's what I'm seeing here. Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. © 2025 reddit inc.

https://www.vice.com/en/article/cancel-culture-meaning/,13-March-2024,What Is Cancel Culture and What Does It Mean in 2024?,"Newsletters By Madeline Lo-Booth Cancel culture, as a concept, has swept the globe in recent years. Though born from a specific social activist group it has exploded into the mainstream. It was the Australian Macquarie Dictionary’s word of the year in 2019 and was also on their shortlist for word of the decade in 2021. But, since at least 2020, it’s been deployed by conservatives as a catchy phrase to incite outrage alongside other ‘“leftie” agendas like political correctness or wokeness. But what is cancel culture? What does it mean to cancel someone or something? And is cancel culture a myth, anyway? You might be wondering how to define ‘cancelled’ – let’s start with the Macquarie Dictionary’s definition of cancel culture. Cancel culture: noun the attitudes within a community which call for or bring about the withdrawal of support from a public figure, such as cancellation of an acting role, a ban on playing an artist’s music, removal from social media, etc., usually in response to an accusation of a socially unacceptable action or comment. In other words, cancel culture is the act of collective boycotting of something or someone after a perceived wrongdoing. The act of getting cancelled is enabled by social media. Despite how Macquarie defines ‘cancelled’ or ‘cancel culture’, cancelling isn’t just targeted at public figures – any person, brand or thing can be cancelled. Author and academic Eve Ng points this out in her definition of the term in Cancel Culture: A Critical Analysis. Ng defines cancelling and cancel culture as both the practice of cancelling someone (an individual, group, organisation, brand or even nation) and the surrounding commentary about their wrongdoing. This means cancelling someone is less like hitting backspace and deleting their name from the page and more like striking through the name and continuing to write about it alongside other people. Some early cancel culture examples can be traced back to what Clyde McGrady, from the Washington Post, defines as the first usage of “cancel” in today’s understanding. The lyrics of Chic’s song “Your Love Is Cancelled”, off their 1981 album Take It Off, is a sparse track punctuated by slap-bass and an undeniably 80s flute synth, where Nile Rodgers sings the titular phrase and gives birth to the metaphor that would culturally peak decades later. Ten years later, the word “cancel” emerges again in a film that boasts an all-star cast including Ice-T and Chris Rock (who had his own brush with cancel culture). In New Jack City, rising drug lord Nino Brown, played by Wesley Snipes, yells “Cancel that bitch!” after a fight with his girlfriend. The same phrase and scene are directly referenced in 50 Cent’s 2005 song “Hustler’s Ambition” and in Lil Wayne’s 2009 track “I’m Single”, securing its existence in the cultural unconscious. When the idea of cancelling re-emerges years later, the misogynistic undertones of these earlier contexts are repressed. But when did cancel culture start? Cancel culture manifested itself into the online term we know and understand now heavily because of social media. Social media was crucial in enabling cancel culture to develop, specifically the online realm of Black Twitter – a space for both serious conversation about matters that affect Black communities, but also a space for humour and entertainment, by and for a collective of Black identities. There, the idea of cancelling, adapting older traditions of dissing and calling out, started alongside hashtag movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter, which helped spread the action and language of cancel culture further. It’s clear that the verb “to cancel” (like the history of other words like “woke”, “cool” and “on fleek”) originated in Black culture but has been appropriated into white mainstream culture globally. This is why it’s particularly interesting that a phrase like cancel culture can be awarded word of the year from Australia’s authority on our version of English, without clear reference to its origins. But, as McGrady points out, the notion of cancel culture has now been weaponised to “sneer at the values of many young Black liberals”, who were integral to the concept coming into popular circulation. After decades of sexual abuse allegations, the hashtag #MuteRKelly led to a successful financial boycott of the now-convicted musician, who was handed a 20-year prison sentence for child pornography earlier this year. Other examples include Woody Allen, Louis C.K. and Kevin Spacey – who at various times were “cancelled” by various groups over abuse allegations. And Pepsi was cancelled after their ad featuring Kendall Jenner was condemned for appropriating a Black Lives Matter protest. But it’s not just happening in the United States, K-pop group BTS were cancelled by Chinese fans over a comment by a band member paying tribute to American and South Korean troops who fought in the Korean war. You also don’t have to be alive to be cancelled. For many, Picasso is cancelled and debates continue on whether Michael Jackson is cancelled. In Australia, more recently, student groups at the University of Melbourne have asked for philosophy academic Holly Lawford-Smith’s classes to literally be cancelled in a campaign on campus and online, that led to debate over academic free speech. Cancel culture has a fraught relationship with free speech. Some argue that cancelling gives rise to the voices of marginalised communities, who have previously had their opinions suppressed. Others say it stifles open debate. The examples listed above suggest there isn’t a specific way to cancel something – the effects of cancel culture are often quite disparate. Different groups of people may consider someone to be cancelled when others do not. There doesn’t appear to be a One Size Fits All to cancelling. While some consider cancel culture as an act of free speech, conservatives have identified cancelling as a threat to free speech. In response, the US Conservative Political Action Conference in 2021 focused on the theme ‘America Uncancelled’. It’s a phrase that’s been plastered on t-shirts ever since. While it may seem that cancel culture and call out culture align with the same purpose, both concepts differ in resolution. Call out culture has more of a direct focus on education and progress, provided the person being ‘called out’ has the desire to grow and learn from their wrongdoings or mistakes. Anyone can be called out, and by doing so, anyone can learn to educate themselves and/or change their perspective for the better. Cancel culture aims to rid the person on the receiving end of any kind of redemption. So while the two are similar, keep in mind that they both come to different conclusions. And if you’re going to cancel or call someone out, remember what you want from it. According to Refocus AU, cancel culture can have definitive effects on the mental health of the person being cancelled because of its ability to socially exclude and alienate. These feelings of isolation then potentially lead to depression and anxiety, and even exacerbate existing mental health conditions. A sense of shame may also be felt by the cancelled person if they are concerned over what people think, or are dealing with the consequences of their actions, and therefore, facing backlash for it. But the cancelled are not the only party affected by cancel culture. The canceller also faces mental health challenges when they accept a fleeting sense of hope and justice as redemption from the cancelled. If the cancelled party doubles down on their opinion or continues to defend themselves from the backlash, this could compromise the sense of hope the canceller holds, and may make them feel like their work and effort wasn’t effective. This may result in feelings of self doubt and helplessness. Carlow University asked counsellors about how to protect your mental health from cancel culture and found that the best solution is to unplug from social media, apologise, refrain from posting online when feeling emotional, consider the feelings of others, and talk to others about your feelings. A gradual sense of acceptance and forgiveness should develop thereafter, and sooner rather than later, you’ll be rid from the torturing dread that follows you (hopefully). No one is ever truly safe from the mental anguish of cancel culture. No matter where you sit on the cancellation scale, you are still vulnerable to the repercussions of it, and its important to look out for yourself if you’re in deep. Many may find cancel culture problematic in itself, and may wonder why or how cancel culture is, or can be, toxic. Cancelling is one way social media was used to establish social justice. But the idea of media or activists playing a role in delivering justice isn’t anything new. Concerns have been raised about the effects of cancel culture on everyday citizens who aren’t as well-resourced or powerful as high profile people. At the same time, cancel culture has brought significant attention to the shortcomings of the legal justice system, particularly in relation to cases of sexual assault. Like any social phenomena, cancel culture is complex, and has been interpreted and deployed in many, many ways. Australian society has seen engaged in it’s fair share of cancellations and cancel culture in recent years as social media becomes the birthing ground for holding people accountable. One particular case, which has proven to be (somewhat) longwinded is the cancellation of Australian band Sticky Fingers. The band’s frontman Dylan Frost was called out online in 2016 by the lead member of First Nations hardcore punk bank Dispossessed for complacent behaviour and shirtfronting at one of their gigs. Frost would be accused of violence in the same year after Indigenous singer Thelma Plum made an online statement detailing an altercation she had with the band member. Many of the band’s attempts to rectify the situation wouldn’t suffice, and the band would essentially face pushback from radio stations, and be removed or blackballed from festival lineups. While acts of cancelling are quite obvious throughout Australian society and culture, many believe that there is a double standard. There have been countless celebrities or public figures who have gone on to be cancelled, however the effects of their cancellation aren’t as felt as people expected. Like when Sonia Krueger called for an end to Muslim migration because she “wants to feel safe” or Samantha Armytage said “good on her” to one twin on live TV for having lighter-coloured hair and eyes as opposed to her darker-haired and skinned twin. Even all-round awful politician Pauline Hanson has been cancelled multiple times for her often racist and xenophobic views, but she still has a backing because, well, we live in Australia. So while the effects of cancel culture are most certainly felt, the length at which people remain cancelled works on a case-by-case basis. The version of cancel culture that conservative factions of society decry, isn’t real. Yes, people are called out for their questionable actions all the time, but a person is only truly cancelled if they face consequences, be they social and/or financial or within the justice system. But we see time and time again that people’s reputations and livelihoods remain firmly in tact even after their wrongdoings are exposed. People and groups can and often are called out, yet they remain protected by the structures of our society – like the patriarchy – enough to hold onto their high-profile jobs or keep getting booked for gigs. Without being held accountable, is someone really cancelled? Madeline Lo-Booth is a journalist who writes on culture and politics.

Percy Hynes White. Image by Xavier Collin / Image Press Agency / Deposit Photos Can you imagine being a man accused of rape and sexual assault and then finding out that you donât know, have never met, and certainly have never even touched the lady whoâs accusing you of this heinous crime? You think you should ignore this, and itâll all go away. Except it doesnât. Instead, more and more accusations are thrown your way, many of which have nothing whatsoever to do with this ladyâs allegations. And soon, people are hating you for what they think they heard that you possibly probably did but they arenât completely sure about. And itâs not just passive hate that these haters carry. Itâs a vengeful type of hate that makes them harass your family, your colleagues, and your friends with offensive and horrific phrases that are meant to tear you apart. They also find your socials and ruthlessly make up accounts with disparaging words aimed at your parents and loved ones so that the hurt is now personal to you. And then there are the death threats and the âkill yourselfâ posts, along with deliberate distortion of your parentsâ attempt to defend you online so that it fits the wicked narrative they are determined to carry about you into the world. Hate has a funny way of unifying people, who are looking for something, anything, anyone to hate. And at times, this unification can turn into a powerful mob of destruction. Can you imagine if such a terrifying mob has you as their target â all because some stranger decided to falsely accuse you of rape and sexual assault? This is exactly what happened to Percy Hynes White, the 21-year old Canadian actor of Netflixâs hit show Wednesday, who started facing some serious allegations on January 19th 2023 (UTC/GMT) on the Twitter platform. Percy Hynes White has finally put out a statement denying these allegations on June 7th 2023 (UTC/GMT). However within that space of 5 months, between January and June this year, Whiteâs sexual assault accusations spread from the Twitterverse into the general Internet Sphere, along with added allegations of misbehaviour that ranged from âracismâ to âmisogynyâ to âcome on, really?!â. This has turned Whiteâs case into a multi-layered state of affairs, that upon peeling back, reveals the undeniable crisis of an uncheckable and unwieldy Cancel Culture. EXPLAINER: How it all Started? Aries and Jane On January 19th 2023 (UTC/GMT), someone called Aries (with the previous Twitter handle @Milkievich that she has recently changed to @Nyxslover) wrote a post accusing White of being a sexual predator since he was 15. Aries claimed that he would abuse and manipulate girls into giving him nude photos or into having sex with him. Then from the ages of 17â20, White would throw parties in his basement, where he would get girls drunk and drugged, in order to sleep with them. Aries continued with exertions that White had assaulted her too, along with her friends which included a girl called Jane. Aries said Jane was underaged at the time, insinuating that White had committed statutory rape. She ended by saying White has rape allegations, and that he also shared nude photos of girls online. The defining problem with all of this? White doesnât even know his accuser, Aries. According to Whiteâs statement on June 7th (UTC/GMT) he has never met Aries @ Milkievich/Nyxslover. His statement reads in part, âEarlier this year, somebody Iâve never met started a campaign of misinformation about me online. Because of this, my family has been doxxed, and my friends have received death threats.â Percy Hynes Whiteâs mother, Sherry White, a Canadian television writer-producer, also confirmed in a tweet on June 4th that said, âthese false rumours were started by a girl heâs never metâ, referring to Aries and her son Percy Hynes White respectively. Jane, the alleged statutory rape victim of Whiteâs, also released a statement on June 7th via her Instagram account that partially read, âTo my knowledge, Aries has never interacted with, or even been in the same room as Percy [White]â. Jane went on to say that âany idea that I was mistreated, groomed, coerced or otherwise made to feel uncomfortable is false. Percy [White] is my friend, and has only ever made me feel safe.â Hence it can be concluded that White never raped Jane, and neither could he have assaulted Aries as heâs never met her. Non-Victims Galore When Aries released her tweets in January of 2023, where she accused White of assault and rape, some other ladies jumped onto Ariesâ bandwagon, and threw their accusations into the ring, implying that they too were Whiteâs victims of assault. They werenât. We contacted Aries, Karis, Desiree and Kayla, all of whom didnât respond. Below is a brief summary about their stance in this case: Karis provided a screen shot of a partial conversation she had with White that in part read, âI felt like you made me think we were actually together but to you it didnât mean anything. Those are the main things that really really hurt meâ to which White admitted that he played with her feelings, that heâd never do something like that now, and apologised to her. Nothing in her dialogue with White said anything about an assault. 2. Desiree Desiree made posts saying that Percy Hynes White, âlet me get raped in his basementâ. She also provided a screen shot of a conversation she had with White where she named a person called R, whom she said raped her and she wanted Whiteâs help in getting R to admit to this. White then replied that it was a delicate situation and he needed to hear all sides. Nothing in her conversation with White proves he had anything to do with her alleged rape by R. On May 28th, mom S.White answered some questions on Twitter about R. She clarified that he was a tenant in an apartment that was situated in her basement. Her son Percy Hynes White was not even living in that house when the supposed rape happened. S.White also said that R was never convicted or charged, and might not even have been reported to the police. She also had this to say in a tweet regarding Desiree: âShe certainly lied. She claimed to also have been a victim of Percy [White]. She made it seem like Percy [White] was present when this alleged [rape] incident happened when in fact it was when he no longer lived in that house. She weighed in to purposefully get him canceled [sic], out of spite.â Desiree vacillated between claims of being a victim of Whiteâs and not being one, finally landing on proclaiming that despite being a victim of Whiteâs friend R, she held White as responsible for her rape by being âan enabler and manipulatorâ because he didnât believe her over R. Itâs vital we keep in mind that in the event of he-said-she-said situations, a third party such as White is not obligated to automatically believe the lady is a victim, just because of her gender. 3. Kayla Kayla is friends with Karis and Desiree. She entered the conversation in an attempt to back up her friendsâ false accusations of rape/assault. In her screen shot of her message to White, she told him to contact her so they could discuss how to proceed. White never replied. In addition to the 3 bandwagon hitchers above, an array of âwitnessesâ came forth with names such as Jo, Daisey and SFM-Josh amongst others, who claimed that they knew girls who were manipulated and abused by White. Jo also claimed that she knew someone who tried to take him to court years earlier when he was in the American TV show The Gifted (2017/18) but nothing was done about it. However no specific names of âvictimsâ were ever mentioned, and the actual supposed âvictimsâ never came forward to verify these claims that White had actually raped/assaulted them. In essence, everyone mentioned above were conveniently talking about nameless and faceless people who were supposedly victims of Percy Hynes Whiteâs (eg. âmy girlfriendâs exâ, âmy classmatesâ etc), but no direct victim ever showed up to actually claim this position. It is worthwhile to note that there were two different entertainment reporters (one being from Rolling Stone mag) who tried contacting a couple of the above mentioned accusers, but subsequently nothing appeared in the media. We also contacted Jo, Daisey and Josh, along with Aries, Karis, Desiree and Kayla, but never got any response from any of them. Libel as Crime in Canada Incidentally, some countries view defamation as tort or a civil matter but Canada is one of those countries that has malicious libel as a criminal activity, with an attached prison sentence of up to 5 years. And the world right now isnât so accepting of women who lie about rape and sexual assault as more and more of such astonishing cases come to the forefront. In the event the accusers above are challenged to a defamation police investigation or law suit, they will have to produce these âvictimsâ they claim to know. In a recent exchange Desiree had with a White-fan recently, Desiree wrote, âIâm a victim of Percyâs [Whiteâs] friends. Not of Percy [White]. But I will hold him accountable for what hundreds of girls are telling me.â It might not be easy to produce hundreds of victims in court or the police station, when not even one has been named and identified. Blast from the Past: More (Questionable) Accusations Amongst the questionable evidence Whiteâs haters and cancellers brought onto social media to prove he deserves to be taken off his show, is a video clip that was meant to show White as racist. White is seen on his phone camera, saying some lines from a script, that includes a racial epithet. However, the clip was clearly made by White in his trailer, while he was rehearsing lines from the TV show Them, where he played a racist antagonist. More dubious evidence include a random video taken off social media, that doesnât belong to White and doesnât even show him in the video itself, that his haters claim is proof of his wild âassaultâ parties. Likewise a snapshot of White being arrested was falsely and presumptuously attributed to his sex parties. His mother S.White confirmed he was arrested as a teenager for graffiti, because he wrote on the step of a pizza parlour. He was let go, with no charges laid. She also said he did have parties, however they were not of the nature described by his cancellers. Whiteâs haters also scoured his deleted Twitter account (handle: @Impercenator) along with his current Instagram account (handle: @Percy), and proceeded to post screen shots of where White liked or commented about certain images/posts which the cancellers decided were âracistâ, ânazi affirmingâ, âhomophobicâ, âmisogynisticâ and âpaedophilicâ in nature. The posts, photos and images, which were not directly written/posted by White, are in fact open to a multitude of interpretation. And most reasonable people will not see anything wrong with them. Although, one of Whiteâs self-written tweets does appear to be at the very least slightly blasphemous. And other tweets he wrote seem troubling and capricious, where he refers to women degradingly as âbitchesâ and âhoesâ, but then counters that with posts defending women and our rights. A query to Whiteâs reps about this went unanswered. Child Porn as Possible Revenge Two sets of photos showing White in the nude were conveniently leaked on Instagram, and the link was sent to some Twitter fans of Whiteâs. One set was shot when he was 13 years old and the other set when he was 17 years old. His mother S.White made her first post on Twitter regarding this on May 6th, where she explicitly explained that the photos of White at 17 were ones he had shared privately in a group chat, and the shots of her son at 13 were when he was catfished and those images were brought to S.Whiteâs attention by the police because the photos were discovered in a case of child pornography. S.White tweeted, â[The photos] were removed by the police and have resurfaced in these recent months and despite numerous reports and complaints twitter has not removed them, so Iâm going to have to get the police involved in order to remove them.â. It is not known if the police was involved this time. Aries, Karis, Desiree and Kayla disappeared from Twitter overnight with S.Whiteâs mention of the police. (Karis and Aries have since returned to Twitter.) Fallout 1 â Comic Con Liverpool White stopped posting on his Instagram account, and deleted his previous Twitter account, very shortly after the accusations began in January. Netflix has renewed Wednesday for a second season, however they have remained silent on the White matter. Furthermore the streamer has not released a confirmed cast list for season 2, which is rumoured to start production at the end of 2023. For the last few months since January, White has remained quiet and under the radar. Then, Comic Con Liverpool added White to its guest list on May 17th, and within hours, hateful and denigrating comments appeared under the announcement, both on Twitter and Facebook. The organisers, Monopoly Events, were forced to suspend ticket sales for Whiteâs appearance, promising to resume sales once his statement was made. Whiteâs statement was released on June 7th, however his ticket sales still remained suspended. The organiser was asked why ticket sales were stopped, and they replied via email that, âIt is due to current controversies he [White] facesâ. When queried further as to whatâs the current status on his ticket sales, they said âWe are still awaiting a decision regarding this, however, if he [White] no longer attends then you [ticket buyers] will be fully refunded automatically.â They also said to keep an eye on their socials for updates about Whiteâs attendance. Then on 17th July, the organisers responded over messaging services that White will no longer be a part of their event. Percy Hynes White at the World Premiere Of Netflixâs âWednesdayâ Season 1 held at the Hollywood American Legion Post 43 at Hollywood Legion Theater on November 16, 2022 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, United States. (Photo by Xavier Collin/Image Press Agency/Deposit Photos) The Jenna Ortega Fanbase Theory Adding to this mix, is a theory that Whiteâs Wednesday co-star Jenna Ortegaâs fanbase isnât happy with White and Ortegaâs close friendship off camera, and would rather Ortega have a relationship, romantic or otherwise, with her other Wednesday costar Emma Myers who plays Enid in the show. The alleged sexual accusations against White provided the perfect avenue for Ortegaâs fanbase to publicly hate on White even more, and many jumped at this opportunity. Testing this theory, I sampled random comments from the Comic Con Liverpoolâs Twitter account, under the post announcing Whiteâs appearance. There were 2 posts, across which I sampled. One post was the announcement itself, and the other post read as follows: âWe were given multiple reassurances before making this announcement. To our knowledge the actor [White] has not been removed from Wednesday.â Both posts garnered slightly more than 1000 direct comments altogether. I sampled 80 of these comments to both posts, in order to get an understanding of who these people were who hated on White. Out of the 80 samples, my findings showed: 35 (43.75%) were indeed Ortega/Myers fans who either had #CancelPercy as their hashtags or whose twitter timeline were filled with anti-White posts. 16 (20%) were what seemed like people who heard about Whiteâs accusations and believed he was guilty, but werenât necessarily fans of Ortega/Myers/Wednesday. 29 (36.25%) were fans of White who were not only excited about his appearance, but who also defended him against the 63.75% negative commenters. However, when I sampled 30 out of the little over 1000 people who had quoted-and-retweeted the announcements with their own comments, an action that is referred to within Twitterverse as âQRTâ, I found rather different statistics: 21 (70%) were people who knew of Whiteâs accusations and believed he was guilty, but werenât ardent Ortega/Myers/Wednesday fans. 5 (16.67%) were Ortega/Myers fans, whose timeline were filled with anti-White posts. 4 (13.33%) were fans of White defending him. Therefore as wild a theory as it is, the sampling statistics prove that a large part of Whiteâs cancellers and haters are indeed Ortega/Myers fans who have a deep disdain for him. However, an even larger part of those anti-White people might be just ones whoâve heard about his allegations and believe heâs guilty, with little to no interest in Ortega/Myers/Wednesday. Either way, Whiteâs hate campaign and/or shaky reputation seems to have gotten him off this Comic Con event in Liverpool, and thatâs very unfortunate. Fallout 2 â The Emmy nominations On July 13th (UTC/GMT), Netflixâs Wednesday along with Ortega were nominated for the upcoming Emmy Awards. In a few hours, on Netflix-Wednesdayâs Instagram account, about 1500 comments proliferated under the post announcing the showâs remarkable 12 nominations. A sampling of the first 100 comments showed that 51 comments carried the #CancelPercy tag or were against White. These comments were liked by the most number of people and therefore appeared at the top. White was not tagged to that Instagram post, but the rest of the major cast were tagged initially by the Streamer. Reputation and Public Image Itâs been more than a month since Whiteâs statement in June, and his haters and cancellers havenât given up taunting Netflix/Wednesdayâs Producers to fire him, and making their presence known anywhere with which the actor is associated. The influx of disapproving comments on the recent Wednesday Emmy-nomination post and Comic Con Liverpoolâs announcements are examples of how the hate for White is still abundant. With Wednesdayâs international success on the Netflix platform, Whiteâs accusations have been heard all around the world, thanks to the internet that carried and ran with the original misinformation and gossip. Also his 5 months of silence didnât help matters. It is safe to say that Whiteâs public image and reputation have taken a beating and the optics surrounding him arenât peachy. Were there missteps in how Percy Hynes White and his reps handled the false accusations? Are there experts and solutions that White and his family can turn to now?
